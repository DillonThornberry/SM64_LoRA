The speedkick double-jump ending movement can be done whether or not you preserve speed, but if you don't preserve speed then a dive rollout over the edge of the mountain can be just as fast, but it will be harder to do optimally.

Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Tip First red coin : This coin is a little tough to grab. As a beginner, the easiest movement is to double jump kick near the top of the tree. Kicking while in the air prevents Mario from grabbing the pole until he lands. This makes it easy to strafe in the air and ensure you grab the coin. For the advanced movement (buffer kick \u2192 double jump \u2192 dive) to grab the coin, delay the buffered kick slightly so that Mario is closer to his peak double-jump height when you dive at the coin.

{"prompt": "Explain Wii VC Round-to-Zero", "completion": "Stream by Switchpalacecorner, after 71.5 hours of raising in Wii Virtual Console   After 146.5 hours (6 days 2.5 hrs)   The original BitFS platform raising discovery by Andru! on May 10th 2018. Wii VC Round-to-Zero  refers to an emulation inaccuracy in the  Wii Virtual Console  (Wii VC) version of SM64. When converting a double precision floating point number (a \"double\") to a single precision floating point number (a \"float\"), the N64 typically uses the round-to-nearest rounding mode. This means that if the double is not exactly equal to a float, it will round up or down to the float that is closest in value to the original number. While this behavior is accurately emulated by most emulators and the Wii U VC, the SM64 Wii VC instead uses the round-to-zero mode. This mode will always round the double up if it is negative, and round it down if it is positive. While the programmers did not intentionally use doubles very often, favoring single precision floats instead, they occasionally used them accidentally. y   -=   sins ( t )   *   0.58 ; t   +=   0x100 ; In the above code sample,  y  and  sins(t)  are both single precision floats. However, in C, the numeric literal  0.58  is a double since it lacks a trailing  f , as in  0.58f . This causes the expression to evaluate to a double, which is then converted to a float before being stored in  y . Examples such as this one arise in many places in the game's source code, and over time they result in large discrepancies between the N64 and Wii VC versions of the game. For this reason, TASes produced for one of these platforms cannot generally be played back on the other without desync. The example given above is taken from the code controlling the oscillation of the platforms at the beginning of  Bowser in the Fire Sea . Using the N64's rounding mode, the  y  variable, which represents the platform's height, will repeatedly return to its original value and continue oscillating with fixed maximum height. Even though each double to single conversion produces a small amount of error, this error balances out over the course of the platform's cycle. On the Wii VC, however, the error always accumulates in the same direction (upward if the platform is below  y  = 0, and downward if the platform is above  y  = 0), and so the platform slowly drifts in the vertical direction. This is known as  Wii VC platform drift . From its starting position of y=-3065 until it reaches y=-2048, this platform rises 254 times by 1/4096th of a unit for each 256 frame cycle, 127 times as it goes up, 127 times as it goes down (at the peak and bottom of the oscillation cycle, the platform stays still so no rounding occurs). So doing the math, 127/128*1/4096units*30frames*60seconds*60minutes, we get that the platform drifts by ~13.0806 units/h. Once it passes y=-2048, the platform halves in rising speed: ~6.5403 units/h. The platform continues to halve in speed as it passes through y=-1024, y=-512, y=-256, and all other 2^n boundaries til it comes to a halt near y=0. As it passes through a 2^n boundary, its behavior becomes complex. Throughout its up-down oscillation cycle, the platform is sometimes past the 2^n boundary and sometimes not. The overall speed decrease as the platform's average height passes through the 2^n boundary is represented by a differential equation of  v y = d y d t = arccos \u2061 ( y ) {\\displaystyle v_{y}={\\frac {dy}{dt}}=\\arccos(y)} : the platform suddenly slows down quickly, then at a slower rate before it decelerates faster again, and finally, suddenly the platform's acceleration completely stops, the speed settling at a constant, half of what it started with. The platforms at the beginning of the level are below  y  = 0, and so they gradually rise upward. Over the course of several days, they are high enough they can be used to reach the elevator past the pole, which previously required one A press to get past. It takes eight days for the platform to reach high enough for a dive recover to land in the elevator shaft, but using  VSC  with a lava boost requires only three days. The glitch was discovered by  xAndru!  when he left his Wii powered on overnight while in Bowser in the Fire Sea and noticed that the oscillating platforms had risen above their original positions. [1] The bug does not occur in any later Wii VC releases, nor in the Wii U VC or in any mainstream N64 emulators. At the time of its discovery, the bug did not occur on the Dolphin emulator, but has since been corrected. [2] No objects other than the sinking platforms are known to have similarly exploitable behavior, though the rounding bug does cause many discrepancies between the original and Wii VC versions of the game, including slightly different surface normals. This bug does not affect the sinking platforms in  Lethal Lava Land  because they are already located at y=0. Applications After several failed attempts by various players, the A press save in  Bowser in the Fire Sea  was console verified RTA on 20 Jun 2018 by Emilia Blue. [3]  Six days later, pannenkoek2012 TASed the red coin star in zero A presses using a modified N64 emulator that replicated the rounding error.

Although this means only the lowest water level can be accessed from the start of the level. Shocking Arrow Lifts!  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/GpLDcOdhchY There is a warp nearby that takes you directly above the star. Top o' The Town  (0x) Video 1 (Chuckya):  https://youtu.be/vc_xUKnw7Z8   Video 2 (VSC):  https://youtu.be/Z25qV3sGIn0   This star is particularly difficult because while you can break the box without pressing  A , the star itself was 1 unit too high for a dive recover to work. It was originally solved when Plush figured out you could hold  Chuckya  as a light object on the bridge. Now, there are 6 different strategies, using Chuckya, VSC, a skeeter clone, a fire clone, a teleporter clone, and a heave-ho. Among these, the VSC strategy is the fastest one. Secrets in the Shallows & Sky  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/9Zc7wORb1FE   The strategy to get this star was to use a heave-ho to get one secret and chuckya to get on the bridge to get to another secret. the other secrets are fairly easy to get by falling from above. Express Elevator - Hurry Up!  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/gxkGeNAdsWg   The problem with this star is that it was originally not possible to get onto the elevator without pressing  A . Eventually, Pannen realized that by raising the water level, he could get on the elevator with half an A press with barely enough time to get on. After that, it was found to be possible without pressing  A  by using negative VSC which gave some time to get on to the elevator without pressing the  A  button. Go to Town for Red Coins  (0x) Video 1 (Water Level Raising):  https://youtu.be/cdM-h1Ge9xk   Video 2 (Faster Strategy):  https://youtu.be/25G6qXpXwHw   Originally, this star was saved because the water in the town bobs up and down by 20 units. If you go through the loading zone in the middle of the tunnel, the water level from the town will be saved and when you come back, the water level will be at the last position it was at. However, when you come back, the water level saved is now used as the median. So, by waiting for the water level to bob up or down by 20 units, unloading and then reloading the town, and repeating this process, you can raise or lower the water level. Later, it was figured out by Iwer Sonsch that one of the red coins could be collected without breaking its box, putting a skeeter on the grey building, and using chuckya to give him some speed where he could use frame perfect B swimming to conserve that speed underwater to swim faster. Iwer then figured out you could clone one of the boxes to save some time, and put a skeeter on the brown building which saved a trip to the town. Pannen also found out that you could conserve more speed after throwing the box clone which helped him swim a lot faster and saved another trip to the town. Quick Race through Downtown!  (0x) Video 1 (Water Level Overflow):  https://youtu.be/2NtxoAgNY80   Video 2 (Cloning):  https://youtu.be/7jqrAohBTxg   Originally, Pannenenkoek2012 was able to do this in a single  A  press by bringing Chuckya to the loading zone and then cloning the star. The strategy used one  A  press to start swimming after grabbing chuckya. In May of 2014, he figured out that by using the water level raising glitch that had been used before, he was able to raise the water level so much that he could overflow the water level, making the water level alternate from being completely full to completely dry. The water level is stored as a 16-bit signed integer which means the only possible values it can be are between -32,768 to 32,767. If the water level goes over 32,767, it will wrap back around to -32,768 and vice versa. In October of 2021, it was figured out that you could actually clone the star without having to press  A  again to swim with chuckya. By having chuckya come over to the loading zone, it was possible for Mario to grab chuckya and rapidly go through the loading zone to clone the star. WDW 100 Coins  (0x) https://youtu.be/WU_6RKfsHE4   This star isn't very problematic as there are enough coins in the main room to get the 100 coin star. However, chuckya was required to get Mario onto the bridge which lets him get a box with 10 coins in it. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge , where  Quick Race Through Downtown!  can either be cloned, or Mario can clip into the cage with a BLJ. In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , only  Shocking Arrow Lifts!  can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , only  Top o' the Town  can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. The JP 1.0 version requires triple jumping into the pipe to avoid opening the cannon. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Shocking Arrow Lifts! ,  Top o' the Town ,  Express Elevator--Hurry Up! , and  Quick Race Through Downtown!  can be collected. The latter two require  Hyperspeed Wall Kicking  and  BLJs  to clip through walls. In the  Floor is Lava Challenge ,  Shocking Arrow Lifts! ,  Top o' the Town ,  Express Elevator--Hurry Up! , and  Quick Race Through Downtown!  can be collected, as Mario starts the course on a wooden board object. and can swim around the course.

Each secret as an origin point with a  hitbox  of 137  units , cylindrically extending upwards by 100 units and downwards by 160 units. [25]  All secrets have a coin overlapped onto it with the same cylindrical hitbox of a radius of 137, but only extending 64 units up and 160 units down. Additionally, a ring of 8 coins is present vertically encircling the secret. Gathering all secrets present a huge problem in the  A Button Challenge  as the secrets are located way above the ground, with the 5th secret being more than 5000 units high from the origin of the course. In  Coinless  challenges, the difference in hitbox means that the secret can be triggered without collecting the coin by accessing the upper 32-unit region, but unfortunately, the top coin of the ring (located at 200 units above the secret) overlaps the region completely. For both challenges, extreme techniques are employed to complete the herculean task. A Button Challenge Video:  \"SM64 - Mario Wings to the Sky - 0x A Presses\"   History Previously, on August 31, 2013, pannenkoek2012 collected the star with 1 A Press, which was used to launch from the  cannon  with a  wing cap  to collect the secrets in the traditional way. At the time, it was believed that constructing a  goomba bridge  by  cloning  is impossible, as the game has a limited number of object slots that can be used, and techniques of making more efficient goomba structures were not discovered yet. The method to create a goomba bridge that requires the least number of goomba clones at the time requires an exponential number of clones. It was known that the  Hat in Hand  can release an object remotely at the  HOLP  (held object's last position) because the HOLP does not update when Mario has a hat in hand.    Goomba Oasis blueprint With the introduction of  Goomba clusters  and  Goomba oases , the required number of goombas quickly dropped down from exponential to quadratic, leading pannekoek2012 to develop a strategy to collect all secrets. Goomba clusters are created by releasing a group of goombas using the same HOLP but from different angles, allowing multiple goombas to stack at the same location. However, due to overlapping hitboxes of these goomba clones, each goomba only has a thin region where it can be interacted with, so Mario needs to be maneuvered very carefully. The goomba oasis is created by using  transport cloning , which occurs when the object is being pushed by an enemy, and releases the clone at the midpoint between its position and the HOLP, but at the HOLP's height, allowing a massive number of goombas occupying the oasis and bridging between the fourth and fifth secrets. The TAS run was completed on May 29, 2015. It took 55 hours to create, with 2 years of planning, resulting in a run that takes 56 minutes to finish. The HOLP takes 28 goombas to reach, the oasis consists of 7 goombas, and the final  goomba staircase  takes 36 goombas to bridge up the oasis, totaling 71 goombas to complete the mission. Setting up the HOLP In order to create a goomba oasis at the ideal location, a specific HOLP needs to be achieved beforehand. Precisely, the HOLP is set at (x, y, z) = (3592, 5170, -42). In the single-star basis, the HOLP can be achieved by building a goomba staircase consisting of 28 Goombas. The process would take 22 minutes to complete [26] .  However, in a full game run of 120 stars, setting up the HOLP can be done much faster by using the HOLP set from  Bowser in the Sky  (BitS). Therefore, in the full ABC run, Mario will first set up a specific HOLP from  Bowser in the Fire Sea  using techniques such as cloning, bob-omb's backward momentum, and pause buffer hitstun, in order to get to the top of BitS quickly for setting up the HOLP at (3558, 5167, -166) for Mario Wings to the Sky. The setup takes 6 and a half minutes to complete [26] . While the HOLP is slightly off by 130 units from the target, it only affects the locations used when transport cloning and does not affect the strategy. Once Mario is done setting the HOLP, Mario will enter Bob-omb Battlefield to start collecting the secrets. If Mario used Bob-omb Battlefield to set the HOLP, he would still need to reenter the course to remove the goomba clones used to reach there. Getting the secrets For the first, second, and third secrets, Mario uses  Backward Shell Hyperspeed  in order to build up high negative speed to launch off from the mountain, allowing the lower three secrets in the air to be collected.  <tabber> 3D view= |-| Top-down view= |-| Side view= |-| </tabber> For the fourth and fifth secrets, the secrets are too high to reach, and this is where the goomba structures come into play. The goomba oasis at the center of the stage provides Mario a way to navigate between the fourth and fifth secrets. Mario then constructs a goomba bridge between the top of the mountain and the fifth secret, then bounces on the oasis to reach the fourth secret. Once all secrets are collected, Mario collects the star to complete the mission. During the construction to set up the HOLP, Mario takes heavy fall damage on his way down to the ground below. Fortunately, the spinning heart on his way up the mountain provides him with a way to refill his HP multiple times. Locations of goomba oasis and goomba clusters In the ABC run of this star, the goombas in the oasis created by transport cloning are in the following positions [27]  according to Pannenkoek: Actual Goomba Position Planned Goal Position (x,z) Planned Collision Point (x,z) x y z HOLP (in actual run): (x,y,z) = (3592.777, 5170.298, -42.7047) P1 -723.422 5170.298 211.7242 (-750, 200) (-5081.06, 329.7855) P2 -1250.5 5170.298 757.8965 (-1200, 780) (-6021.06, 1489.786) P3 -1494.17 5170.298 1137.558 (-1420, 1220) (-6421.06, 2369.786) P4 -1290.22 5170.298 1191.829 (-1290, 1200) (-6161.06, 2329.786) P5 -1078.41 5170.298 1158.104 (-1136, 1200) (-5853.06, 2329.786) P6 -815.142 5170.298 1151.683 (-891, 1200) (-5363.06, 2329.786) P7 -705.906 5170.298 1093.542 (-719, 1200) (-5019.06, 2329.786) Final Goomba Staircase (Cluster) HOLP Value (x, y, z) Number of Goombas in a cluster H 1420.3 4273.5 -3519.3 8 I 1253.3 4407.1 -3259.6 7 J 1035.8 4540.6 -2889.1 6 K 805.5 4674.1 -2496.5 5 L 566.8 4807.7 -2083.5 4 M 306.6 4941.2 -1647.6 3 N 37.9 5074.7 -1188.4 2 O -256.7 5208.3 -670.4 1 Coinless Challenge   The \"bowling ball centipedes\" created to collect the 5 secrets coinless. Video (Coinless):  \"SM64 - Mario Wings to the Sky - Coinless\"   On November 24, 2013, Pannenkoek completed Mario Wings to the Sky coinless. The run was done before he completed the mission without A presses. The TAS run was 73 minutes long. Pannenkoek made use of  premature clones , which are cloned objects that do not have some of their properties fully loaded. Using this exploit, all five secrets could be collected coinless by cloning away the top ring of coins prematurely. For the first 3 secrets, Mario brought a cork box to the island  hands-free  with the wing cap, waited for a while to grab the fake cork box right as it unloads, and then released a clone of the top coin immediately as it loads. Once the top coin was out of the way, Mario flew to the secret without touching the other coins. More complicated strategies were required to reach the fourth secret [28] . Mario began by setting the HOLP somewhere in the air and putting a clone of an object with a hurt hitbox, such as a bowling ball. To do so, Mario flew to the flagpole with hat-in-hand glitch and dropped a bowling ball clone by releasing it at the flagpole (spawning it at the flagpole's height but at the HOLP laterally). Then, Mario flew towards the fourth secret with a clone, got hurt by the bowling ball, and removed the top coin by premature cloning while falling through the secret's hitbox. Because Mario was hatless, Pannenkoek held the A button during the descent to prevent fall damage killing Mario. The last secret was extremely difficult to get, as the location was too high to release clones, and the ring was too high to reach from the ground (using a cannon will drop the object, and the location had to be reached holding hands free with a clone). Pannenkoek constructed \"bowling ball centipedes\" by first creating a bowling ball clone as high as he could, then set up the HOLP via a cannon shot with a wing cap, and finally dove on a bob-omb right as he got hurt with a bowling ball to set an even higher HOLP for a Goomba clone to be placed there. In the end, there were 6 tangible goomba clones and 1 bowling ball clone, where Mario would fly to the base of the structure as the wing cap ran out and bounce on the goombas to release a premature clone of the top coin, and finally collects the 5th secret while falling. To avoid taking big fall damage on the way down, a goomba clone was placed below acting as a landing pad. Mario then grabbed the star on the ground. CCC Challenge   The moment Mario ascends the goomba staircase to collect the 5th secret as the bowling ball hits him. Video 1 (Goomba cloning):  \"BoB Mario Wings to the Sky Coinless/Capless/Cannonless\"   Video 2 (VSC strat)  \"BoB Mario Wings to the Sky Coinless/Capless/Cannonless Improved Strat Using VSC\"   History CCC Challenge stands for Coinless, Capless, and Cannonless. The restriction of coinless was already difficult to circumvent, and at the time the coinless run was made, it was thought to be impossible. However, as more advanced techniques such as  goomba clusters ,  pause buffered hitstun  and  Parallel Universes  were found, Pannekoek began planning a route to get the secrets without collecting coins and without the aid of Wing Cap and cannons. First Four Secrets The run began by entering  Whomp's Fortress , carrying a cork box to the top and placing a HOLP at (x, y, z) = (-1500, 5437, 1219) for the fifth secret later. In Bob-omb Battlefield, the ring of coins surrounding the secret is only loaded one frame after Mario enters the activation radius, and not on the frame Mario activates it. Therefore, there is a one-frame window where Mario can collect the secret without touching the coins, but in order to do so, Mario needs to be move at more than 2000 speed [29] , which is 10 times faster than the speed used in hyperspeed flying with wing cap in 120-Star TAS speedrun. To execute this strategy, Pannekoek constructs a  PU  route. For the first secret, Mario reaches negative 1.66 million speed (3.83 million for the second secret) by  pause-buffered BLJs  to navigate to \"midway point\" [30]  with an  Overflow Jump  (OJ), dropping down to 0.98 million speed (speed drops are done by rapidly pressing A) in order navigate up the hill [30]  with another OJ, and finally dropping down to about 404 thousand speed to horizontal launch back to the main map while collecting one of the secrets. In order to have Mario stop exactly on the main map collecting the secret, the movement is set so that his final launch movement has one of its  Quarter Step  being out of bounds.

The object is a bob-omb exploded by a nearby water bomb and turns into a bowling ball after cloning. For constructing a goomba bridge, the cap cannot be used in the challenge, so Pannenkoek resorts to pause-buffered hitstun to release clones remotely. With a bob-omb explosion clone allowing Mario to stay under hitstun indefinitely, and a goomba clone detonating oncoming bob-ombs that would remove the hurtbox of the explosion clone, Mario can begin mass-cloning goombas. The initial Goomba Bridge takes 45 goomba clones to complete, and it is only 1 object away from a game crash due to having too many objects on the screen. Mario begins climbing the goomba staircase, releasing a premature clone to remove the top coin. The bowling clone created earlier allows Mario to immediately reverse the direction upon hitting the secret, so as to not collect the other coins. Final Goomba Staircase (Cluster) HOLP Value Number of Goombas in a cluster ID x y z First run (45 goombas) Second run (38 goombas) A 1253.35 4635.129 -3244.78 9 8 B 1039.486 4768.111 -2864.65 8 7 C 813.4499 4902.193 -2462.71 7 6 D 536.9371 4997.725 -1971.01 6 5 E 243.9974 5093.257 -1450.26 5 4 F -65.4559 5188.788 -899.986 4 3 G -391.485 5284.318 -320.371 3 2 H -733.979 5379.852 288.7814 2 1 I -1164.62 5433.383 856.1966 1 2 It was only after the TAS run was completed that Pannekoek found out the distance between Cluster I and the bowling ball is closer than expected. Therefore, the run was later improved by setting the HOLP at cluster I instead, since Mario actually has enough distance to slow down on its own with 2 goomba clones placed there. This reduces the number of goomba clones to 38. The Fifth Secret (using VSC) Pannenkoek later improves the strategy by collecting the 5th secret with  vertical speed conservation , bringing the required time to complete the level down to only 3 minutes. This is done by storing a huge vertical speed by first accumulating massive horizontal speed and converting it using a double jump while holding a cork box clone to remove the top coin by premature cloning. The procedure was done in the following steps: Mario grabs a bob-omb in the grassy area near the Chain Chomp for cloning. He passes by the Chain Chomp. The cloned Bob-omb is brought to a platform close to a ledge. He kills exactly 2 out of 3 Goombas at the edge of the course to manipulate object slots for cloning. He drops the cloned bob-omb to let it slowly walk back to its home while ensuring the Water bombs do not interrupt it. He holds a cork box while manipulating the water bomb (#1) to have the next countdown at the highest value (49 frames) to not interfere with object slots later. He drop the cork box at the launching spot (close to a ledge) and start the cork box despawn timer (30 seconds / 900 frames). Mario has to return to this spot by that point. He lingers slightly to let the bob-omb walk slightly closer to the ledge since Mario still has time. He walks back to the grassy area to activate the water bomb (#2) so that the countdown is greater than zero. He drops down to the lower area near the elevator and purposely lights up the fuse of a bob-omb for object slot manipulation purposes. As Mario begins his BLJ, the bob-omb lit up by the previous step explodes, and its coin will unload exactly one frame after the cork box unloads. With massive negative speed, Mario navigates to a tree and drops down to convert it from negative to positive. The launch will cross the water bomb (#2)'s launch radius. Mario does a double jump up the ledge, converting 1/4 of the horizontal speed into vertical speed at the expense of losing some horizontal speed. He lands on the first frame (on the ledge) while going to C^ mode to conserve the stored vertical speed. Mario is currently in the water bomb (#1)'s activation radius, and therefore the following procedure needs to be done very quickly. The cork box unloads exactly as Mario grabs the cork box, causing him to hold a fake object of Vacant Spot 1 (VS1). One frame later, the bob-omb's coin unloads (from step 9), and Mario is holding VS2. The bob-omb (from step 4) pushes Mario off the ledge to reactivate the stored vertical speed, and Mario launches upwards. During Mario's launch, the new cork box loads into VS1, and the cork box spawner unloads to create a new VS1. (If Mario was holding VS1 at the time, he would have cloned a new cork box) The Goomba (from step 3) unloads, allowing Mario to hold VS3. This is where the top coin of the ring will load into, allowing Mario to release a premature clone later. Mario falls through the secret's hitbox without touching the coins nearby. With -75 vertical speed from falling, only a few trajectories can reach the 32-unit area where the secret can be collected coinless. Mario then collects the star.

{"prompt": "Explain Negative jump", "completion": "A  negative jump  is a jump done with enough negative speed that Mario ends up going down instead of up. When Mario  Single Jumps  or  Double Jumps , his vertical speed is set to a constant plus his horizontal speed divided by 4. This means that if his horizontal speed is high and positive, he will jump very fast upwards, but if his horizontal speed is extremely negative, he will jump downwards with high negative vertical speed for 1 frame before terminal velocity takes effect. The negative horizontal speed required to make Mario's initial vertical speed from his jump be less than 0 is -168 units/sec for single jumps and -208 units/sec for double jumps."}

{"prompt": "Explain Movement Guide", "completion": "This is a guide for movement in RTA speedruns. It will help you get familiar with common terminology for movement options and discuss the mechanics associated with them.

It provides a solid foundation that can be built on with the movement options listed below.  Load video YouTube YouTube might collect personal data.  Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Basic Movement Options Single Jump  - Press A to single jump. How long you hold A determines Mario's height during the jump. Maximum height is proportional to Mario's horizontal speed. Double Jump  - Upon landing from a single jump, kick, sideflip, or walking off of a ledge, press A when Mario makes contact with the ground to double jump. This jump gives Mario more height than a single jump. Similar to a single jump, how long you hold A during the double jump will discern Mario's height and maximum height is dependent on horizontal speed. Triple Jump  - Upon landing from a double jump, press A when Mario makes contact with the ground to triple jump. You must have at least 20 horizontal speed to carry out this move, and it is also not possible to ledge grab out of a triple jump. Unlike single and double jumps, triple jumps are always the same height. Long Jump  - While Mario is moving, hold Z and press A to long jump. Sideflip  - While Mario is running in any direction, flick the stick in the opposite direction to make Mario start sliding. While Mario is in this sliding state, you can perform a sideflip by tilting the stick in your desired direction and pressing A. Backflip  - While standing still, hold Z and press A to backflip. This technique has very few applications in an RTA run, but the most common use is on the  Advanced CCM Wall Kicks Will Work  strategy. Walljump/Wallkick  - While Mario has forwards momentum and is within approximately 45\u00b0 of a vertical wall, he can perform a wallkick. When you get close to the wall, press A to wallkick. There are 5 frames in which Mario is able to wallkick, and each frame is slightly different. The most notable wallkick first-frame wallkick, also known as a firstie/firsty where Mario will gain speed out of the wallkick. On 2nd through 5th-frame wallkicks Mario loses some height each frame. Punch  - While standing still on the ground or with low forward momentum, press B to punch.  Pressing B while crawling, or pressing B with high horizontal high speed while holding neutral on the stick will also perform a punch. Kick (on ground)  - While standing still on the ground or with low forward momentum with the A button held, press B to do a kick. Kick (in air)  - While in the air with little to no forward momentum, press B to kick. Dive  - While grounded or in the air with a lot of forward momentum, press B to dive. Being able to perform a kick or dive in specific parts of the game requires some effort. A common point of failure among beginner runners is trying to do double jump kicks in Bowser in the Sky. This is great movement to practice to get a feel for how to kick versus how to dive. Dive Recover/Rollout  - While Mario is in the dive animation and hits the floor, you can press either A or B to roll out of the dive. Some players slide their finger from A to B (for two chances) to try and make the rollout dustless. When doing long jumps, dive recovers, and slide kick rollouts you have a large window to hit the next movement. Dustless rollouts can be performed on the first possible frame. If performed correctly, no dust will be generated under Mario, hence the name dustless. Mario does not lose any speed with dustless movements. If you roll out over an edge, Mario will be in a state where he does not take damage, but cannot ledge grab, kick, wallkick, or ground pound. Slide Kick  - While Mario has forward momentum, hold Z and press the B button to perform a slide kick. Slide kicks have the property of quick startup, so it is preferred in very specific instances. One common spot is when going to talk to the penguin inside the CCM slide area. Ground Pound  - While Mario is in the air in a jumping or falling state, you can hit Z to ground pound. It is very common to ground pound under stars, since it extends Mario's hitbox upwards and he falls down faster after grabbing the star. The same thing applies to breaking boxes to grab stars. If you hit A+Z on the same frame while grounded, Mario will ground pound. Mistakes often occur during speedruns when the runner attempts to long jump but instead ground pounds. Ledge Grab  - Mario can grab a ledge out of any state with 3 exceptions. You cannot ledge grab if you are in a dive recover state, on a steep slope, or in a triple jump. This is why players often chain a triple jump with a wallkick so they can ledge grab. Swimming  - Press A to swim. Maximum swimming Fspeed is 28 and falls to 26 before the next A press. Optimal swimming is on a 20 frame cycle; there are 13 frames where pressing A will be too early and do nothing, then 7 frames where pressing A will result in maximum speed, and beyond that pressing A will result in slower swimming speed. Regardless of when the A button is pressed in the 7 frame window, this 20 frame cycle will repeat. Flying  - To start flying, Mario must have a Wing Cap equipped and perform a triple jump. This triple jump is unique, since it can be done in place, whereas a regular triple jump cannot. A good general practice while flying is to try and make smooth parabolic arcs to retain your speed. If you are falling or ground pounding with the Wing Cap on, you can hold A to fall slower. Crawling  - While standing still, holding Z and a direction on the stick will make Mario crawl.

Immediate Jumps on slopes  - While Mario is on a slope with the Z button held, you can instantly jump or jumpdive much faster than if you were not. This is useful for  Whomp's Fortress 100 Coin ,  Lethal Lava Land  movement, and  Tall Tall Mountain reds . Twirling  - When Mario bounces off a Spindrift or Fly Guy, or gets sucked into a tornado in Shifting Sand Land, he enters a twirling state. While in this state, you can hold A to make Mario spin faster and cover more ground as he descends. When landing on an enemy (such as the  bird star  in SSL), holding neutral while bouncing conserves your horizontal speed and direction until you move the stick again. Pole Grab  - When you grab the bottom of a pole, Mario will try to catch it but fail most of the time. If you mash B, he will keep trying to regrab the pole instead of falling off of it. You will see this a lot when runners try to do  Lakitu Bounce  in Rainbow Ride or grab the pole in  Bowser in the Sky Reds . Quick Turn  - When holding neutral while landing (e.g. from a rollout), Mario will lose all momentum and perform a quick-stop animation. By inputting a direction on the stick during this quick-stop animation, Mario will begin to move, cancelling the quick-stop animation. Once Mario's speed returns to zero, the next directional input will be a quick turn, and Mario will instantly face the direction you input. Speedkick  - This is probably the most difficult movement option in the game. At a high level, you speedkick to maintain your speed and get a specific amount of spacing into some other movement option like a triple jump wallkick or a jump dive. To do a speedkick, Mario must be moving. Before he makes contact with the ground, you must be holding A and the control stick must be slightly tilted in the direction you want to speedkick. If you've played any Super Smash Bros. games before, it is similar to performing tilts instead of smash attacks. Finally, when Mario hits the ground, hit B to speedkick.

Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Camera Mechanics Though it may seem unintuitive at first, using different camera angles can be very helpful for a wide variety of movement throughout the game. Manipulating the camera is also a key part of lag reduction. Play around with the camera modes and see what works best. When watching the videos on this site, make sure to pay attention to the cameras that are being used. It is not always easy to implement right when you start learning, but it is good to be aware of them. Lakitu Cam  - Lakitu Cam has fixed rotations in most stages. The clearest example of this is in Bowser secret stages, which are widely open and Lakitu can move freely. This is very useful to perform specific movements or tricks in the game because you can guarantee the same angle every time. In other stages, like Bob-Omb Battlefield, Lakitu Cam acts more unpredictably due to the camera colliding with walls as Mario moves around. If you double tap the R button, the camera refocuses at the original distance from Mario. When falling large distances, this is useful to get the camera behind Mario again instead of waiting for it to catch up to him. Common examples of this are in  CCM 100 coins  or  Wall Kicks Will Work  when you intentionally fall to the bottom of the stage. Mario Cam  - Mario Cam is best described as directly following behind Mario. When using Mario Cam, it is most often used in the C-down version. In places where Lakitu Cam fails to turn or follow well, Mario Cam is often used to see better. Mario Cam is also very helpful for setting specific angles upon stage entry. Some common stars to use this for are at the start of CCM 100 to grab the first red and LLL to enter the volcano. Castle Cam  - For lack of a better term, the camera gets fixed to certain viewpoints for some areas. Most notably, inside the castle lobby and inside the mansion for Big Boo's Haunt. In these areas, you can switch between Lakitu Cam and Mario cam, but lose the functionality of using the C-down versions of these. In BBH however, if you enter the mansion in Mario Cam C-down, that camera will persist as long as you do not switch back to Lakitu Cam (This is useful for a number of stars in BBH). This is not an option for the lobby, since when you enter, you are changing loading zones. Underwater Cam  - When swimming, the camera will always follow behind Mario. The only difference between Mario Cam and Lakitu Cam for swimming is how close the camera is to Mario. If you need to use specific cameras while swimming (to lag reduce or swim through rings), you have to hold the C-button for the direction you want the camera to pan for as long as you need it. When you let go, it will pan back to directly behind Mario. Some players prefer to switch to a claw grip on their controller for swimming to make this easier. Tricks VS Movements While it's not always clear cut to distinguish what constitutes a trick and what constitutes movement, we have a common saying in the community. \"Tricks save seconds, movement saves minutes.\" Basically, if you want to optimize your personal best quickly, sinking time into how Mario moves and interacts with different parts of stages will help you gain strong fundamentals. If you focus on specific tricks (pillarless,  lavaboost , lakitu bounce, etc,) the time you spend learning those stars does not really improve your game as a whole. That being said, there are several runners who jumped in the deep end (reset over every failed trick until they became consistent) and still made it to the top. Pick what best works for you and make sure you are having fun with the game. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e RTA Guide Platforms Nintendo 64  \u2022  Virtual Console  \u2022  Emulator Categories 0/1 Star  \u2022  16 Star  \u2022  70 Star  \u2022  120 Star  \u2022  31 Star  \u2022  50 Star  \u2022  All\u00a0!

Behavior On each frame, Wiggler's body segments are updated to match Wiggler's head, preventing individual segments from becoming stuck. When Mario enters the cave from above, Wiggler's dialogue appears and then Wiggler begins walking. Wiggler has 4 different top speeds depending on its health. These speeds are 2, 40, 30, and 16 units per frame for 1, 2, 3 and 4 health respectively. Wiggler approaches its top speed at 1 unit per frame per frame. On the US version of the game, Wiggler's health is not set to 4 until Wiggler finishes talking, meaning its top speed is 113762.3 units per frame for 1 frame. If Wiggler's health is 4, Wiggler walks around randomly, with its target angle increasing or decreasing by 90 degrees each frame. Otherwise, Wiggler's target angle will be its angle to Mario effectively making Wiggler chase Mario. If Wiggler collides with Mario, Wiggler decelerates to a stop at 1 unit per frame per frame and then resumes walking. When Wiggler takes damage, Wiggler's dialogue is displayed and then it goes back to walking or begins shrinking if its health is 1. If Wiggler's health is 1, a star spawns, Wiggler shrinks, and then walks around until it falls through the floor.

They come in two varieties; one that jumps back and forth, and one that throws snowballs at Mario. A total of 4 appear in the game. Contents 1   Behavior 1.1   Snowball Type 1.2   Jumping Type 2   References Behavior Mr. Blizzard is initialized according to what type it is. If it is the jumping kind, its action is set to the jumping action and its target angle is set to its current movement angle. Otherwise, the game checks if it is the Mr. Blizzard in Snowman\u2019s Land. If it is, it checks whether or not it should be wearing Mario\u2019s cap. Then, the game sets it to begin its action loop. Snowball Type This Mr. Blizzard is hidden 200 units beneath the floor until Mario comes near. If Mr. Blizzard is not already set to hold a snowball, one is spawned. When Mario gets within 1000 units of Mr. Blizzard, a sound plays, its moving angle is set to face Mario, it becomes visible and tangible, its pop-up speed is set to 42 and its action is set to pop-up. Mr. Blizzard\u2019s stored position begins increasing from -200. It increases by 42, then 32, then 22, then 12, then 2. Once the stored position reaches -90, its head pops up, its cooldown timer is set to 5, and its pop-up velocity is set to 47. While the cooldown timer is above 0, Mr. Blizzard remains in place. Once it reaches 0, Mr. Blizzard\u2019s stored position is increased by 47, then 37, then 27. On the next frame, Mr. Blizzard\u2019s Y-position is increased by 14 units, its stored position is set to 24, its Y-velocity is set to 17 (gravity instantly changes it to 13) and it moves on to its next action.  Mr. Blizzard rotates towards Mario at 8.44 degrees/frame. Mr. Blizzard\u2019s facing angle in the roll direction is set equal to a \u201cdizziness\u201d value every frame. If the difference between the angle to Mario and Mr. Blizzard\u2019s angle is less than 0, Mr. Blizzard\u2019s change in dizziness will be increased or decreased by a value of 8. This dizziness change is then applied to Mr. Blizzard\u2019s dizziness value. Otherwise, the dizziness value is stored and the change in dizziness value approaches 1000 for a dizziness value below 0 and -1000 for a value above 0. The game then increments the dizziness value by this amount and if it has the opposite sign of the previously stored dizziness value, the dizziness change and dizziness value are both set to 0. If the dizziness value is not 0 and Mr. Blizzard\u2019s rolling angle is greater than 67.5 degrees, Mr. Blizzard dies and disappears unless the distance between Mario and Mr. Blizzard is greater than 1000 units. Otherwise, if the distance between Mario and Mr. Blizzard is greater than 1500 units, Mr. Blizzard goes back into the ground. Otherwise, if 60 frames have elapsed since Mr. Blizzard\u2019s last action and the difference between Mario and Mr. Blizzard\u2019s angles is less than 11.25 degrees, Mr. Blizzard throws a snowball. After throwing the snowball, another one is generated and Mr. Blizzard goes back to following Mario by rotating.  Jumping Type Jumping Mr. Blizzard has a cooldown timer set to 15 after it completes a jump and set to 30 after it begins turning around. When the cooldown reaches 0, if Mr. Blizzard is not more than 700 units from its home laterally, Mr. Blizzard jumps with an initial Y-velocity of 50 units/frame and a forward velocity of 10 units/frame. It takes 25 frames for Mr. Blizzard to complete a jump. When Mr. Blizzard reaches a position more than 700 units away from its home laterally, Mr. Blizzard\u2019s target angle is increased by 180 degrees, Mr, Blizzard\u2019s cooldown is set to 30 frames, its distance from its home is set to 0, and it jumps into the air with a Y-velocity of 25 units/frame. Then, Mr. Blizzard rotates towards its target angle at 3400 angular units (18.68 degrees)/frame and begins jumping again.

A Button Challenge This star can be done in 0 A-presses. The strategy is to navigate to the freezing pond, bounce off a  Spindrift  to reach the exclamation boxes, and then use a dive recover to open the box containing the Koopa Shell. Then, the shell is ridden up to the edge of the stage and  Backward shell hyperspeed  is used to build up speed to reach the ice platform with the penguin. From there, Mario bounces off a Fly Guy to reach the star. In the RTABC challenge, this star is collected in 1 A-press by using the cannon.

The game is beaten by collecting it. After it is collected, it triggers the ending cutscene, and then credits. The Grand Star is significantly larger than other stars, and it does not increase the star counter. Behavior When the Grand Star spawns, it emits sparkles and rotates at 5.625 degrees per frame. After 70 frames, it emits more sparkles and then begins to arc toward the center of the map. The arc's exact trajectory is dependent on the location of the spawn point relative to the center of the map, but the Grand Star moves vertically with an initial y-velocity of 60 units per frame and a gravity value of -2. Once the Grand Star's y-value drops below its home, its forward speed is set to zero and its y-velocity is reset to 60 so that it will bounce. After the bounce occurs, the Grand Star will stop moving completely as soon as its height is 200 units above the ground at which point it becomes tangible. When Mario interacts with the Grand Star, he is put into the Grand Star action and the game's ending cutscenes will begin. The ending cutscene beginning is not dependent on Mario being in the final Bowser level, if the Grand Star is spawned in other levels with cheats the ending cutscenes will begin so long as Mario is not placed out-of-bounds after collecting the Grand Star.

{"prompt": "Explain PU - Floating point truncation crash", "completion": "A diagram of Parallel Universe movement in  Hazy Maze Cave , after  Mario  has returned to the main map. A  Parallel Universe , or  PU , is a region of space located far outside the intended map boundaries that reflects certain aspects, especially the floors and/or ceilings, of the main map. When the game looks for floors below (or ceilings above) a given object, it first \"truncates\" the object's position from a floating point value to a 16-bit integer value. The range of a floating point value is much larger than the range of a 16-bit integer value (which is -2 15  = -32,768 to 2 15  - 1 = 32,767). If a coordinate of the object's position falls outside this range, it \"wraps around\". For example, if one of these floating point values is 40,000, then 40,000 - 65,536 = -25,536 will be used when determining if the object is aligned with a floor or ceiling. This gives the illusion that the floors and ceilings of the main level map are \"copied\" repeatedly in a uniform 3D grid, at a spacing of 65,536 units.   Frame of Peter Fedak's video where he turns Parallel Universes visible using hacks; notice the lack of  objects The truncation responsible for the existence of parallel universes is only performed when determining alignment with floors and ceilings. This means that walls and objects, both of which use floating point arithmetic to determine collision, do not \"exist\" in PUs, unless they are brought there. Due to the extremely high speed required to travel to PUs, they are not accessible from all courses. The courses where PUs can or cannot be accessed are summarized in the tables below. Work is ongoing to try to access PUs in courses such as  Bowser in the Fire Sea  (via  Bully battery ) and demo courses (via massive  Spawning displacement ). Methods to access a PU are: Speed: EBLJ HSW HSP BB Speed Conservation Displacement: Pole Teleport Platform Displacement Note that EBLJ (and other types of BLJs), and BB (Bully battery) cannot be achieved on Shindou versions. Also, if a method requires to set  HOLP  in a PU, then it is only possible to do it on VC (because other versions crash if a camera is in the PU, and by locking camera on the main map, the HOLP wont update, because camera being too far is one of the cases where HOLP doesn't update).

However, these behave completely differently to horizontal PUs. While truncated coordinates are used to  find  the floor below the object and the ceiling above the object, the original floating point values are used to determine what  effect  these surfaces have on the object. For example, when Mario is less than 160 units below the nearest ceiling, he is considered to be \"above\" the ceiling, his vertical speed is killed, and he bonks. If Mario moves to a positive (upward) vertical PU, the \"nearest\" ceiling will be determined based on truncated coordinates, and will therefore be in the main map. But when checking whether he is above this ceiling, floating point coordinates are used instead, and so Mario behaves as though he is stuck in a ceiling. This behavior results in positive vertical PUs appearing to be filled entirely with ceilings. [2] On the other hand, when Mario is below his \"nearest\" floor, he will snap up to it. This means that if Mario moves to a negative vertical PU, he will usually upwarp back to the main PU grid. This is called an  overflow jump , or  OJ  for short. It is typically difficult to get to a vertical PU. In the positive direction, there is a ceiling at  y  = 20,000 that prevents upward movement. We can bypass this ceiling by pressing against OoB, for example by using  hyperspeed flying . We can also use  platform displacement  or  indefinite owl flight  to reach a positive vertical PU. In the negative direction, we can use a  negative jump  to jump downward with large amounts of negative speed, or platform displacement. Travel and movement   Mario looking to the original map from a PU   Mario  BLJing  to a PU Parallel universes have found uses in both speed TASes and the  A Button Challenge  since they allow greater control of movement through a level. PU routing is comparable to movement through a five-dimensional space, as Mario can be modeled as traveling along five axes: three \"relative\" axes describing his position within the map, and two integers to specify which PU he is currently in. These PU axis integers are Mario's coordinates on the PU grid. Mario can adjust his  speed  and  angle  to move relatively around the stage regardless of how many PUs he moves in the  x  or  z  dimensions. Mario's movement is split up into four  quarter steps , and if any of these quarter steps attempts to place Mario out of bounds, his movement is canceled. Therefore in order to move to a PU, Mario's speed must be a multiple of four times the distance between PUs. If Mario takes all four quarter steps, then he will move four PUs in a single frame. This distance is called the  Quadruple Parallel Universe , or  QPU , distance. If one of Mario's quarter steps (other than the first one) ends out of bounds, the game will cut his movement short. In this case, Mario does not travel the full QPU distance, and instead ends at whichever PU he made it to before his intended quarter step became out of bounds. He is then \"QPU misaligned.\" As traveling to PUs involves moving very far from the origin, floating point imprecision can begin to have a significant effect on Mario's position, angle, and collision. When Mario's position becomes large enough, this imprecision will result in the coordinates in PUs becoming so coarse that Mario cannot cross from one coordinate to the next and, eventually, will result in certain PUs being completely unaccessible. Floating point truncation crash While in theory the grid of PUs extends indefinitely, the behavior of the truncation operation becomes \"undefined\" when the floating point value is outside the range -2 31  to 2 31  - 1. The Nintendo 64 and  iQue  Player [3]  versions of the game crash when such a truncation is attempted. The Wii and Wii U virtual console versions of the game do not crash, though it is not currently known whether they wrap around the 32-bit integer range, or cap to the endpoints of the range. Most emulators do not properly emulate the crash, except for a specific version of Mupen64, modded to crash correctly. While movement to PUs at coordinates this large is rarely useful, this crash can occur due to other instances of truncation in the game, even in PUs close to the main map. For example, when determining Mario's tilt while walking, the game multiples Mario's speed by 16,384 and then truncates this value. This means that the game can crash in certain conditions when Mario has a speed of about 131,000, which is below QPU speed. While not all conditions for these types of crashes are known, there are some that come up frequently. These are when: The camera enters a PU Mario bonks while in a PU Mario's quarter step gets canceled while on the ground Mario collides with a wall head-on with PU speed Miscellaneous behavior Certain objects and graphics behave interestingly while in parallel universes.

In order to trigger Bowser's text after defeating him, Mario must be within a short distance of him and face towards the center of his body. The \"whoosh\" sound that plays while spinning Bowser is not indicative of whether he is pointing towards a bomb; try to focus on aiming  visually . It is highly recommended that runners who play using an original Nintendo 64 controller switch to a different controller for Bowser fights, as rapidly spinning the N64 controller's stick will wear it down. Recommended controllers include a Hori Mini Pad, a  Retro-Bit Tribute 64  or  Warrior64 , or a GameCube controller via a  Raphnet adapter .

{"prompt": "Explain C%5E hyperspeed", "completion": "C^ Hyperspeed  is a  hyperspeed glitch  that allows Mario to build up unbounded speed by sliding down a slippery slope while trying to enter first person mode. Execution The trick happens when the player enters first person mode by pressing C^. Usually Mario's speed decreases and he comes to a stop, but if he is on a very slippery slope (type 0x13) he will accelerate. If he is facing uphill, he will get negative speed, and if he is facing downhill, he will get positive speed. If he is facing exactly 90\u00b0 to the slope, he will still gain negative speed. The C^ action can be cancelled with a kick, a punch, becoming airborne, or hitting a wall. If it is not cancelled, Mario will slow down and enter first person mode once he exits the slope.

{"prompt": "Explain Movement Guide", "completion": "This is a guide for movement in RTA speedruns. It will help you get familiar with common terminology for movement options and discuss the mechanics associated with them. Note that these various movement options can be chained together to create more complex movement options. For example, doing a triple jump followed by a wallkick is called a \"triple jump wallkick\".

It provides a solid foundation that can be built on with the movement options listed below.  Load video YouTube YouTube might collect personal data.  Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Basic Movement Options Single Jump  - Press A to single jump. How long you hold A determines Mario's height during the jump. Maximum height is proportional to Mario's horizontal speed. Double Jump  - Upon landing from a single jump, kick, sideflip, or walking off of a ledge, press A when Mario makes contact with the ground to double jump. This jump gives Mario more height than a single jump. Similar to a single jump, how long you hold A during the double jump will discern Mario's height and maximum height is dependent on horizontal speed. Triple Jump  - Upon landing from a double jump, press A when Mario makes contact with the ground to triple jump. You must have at least 20 horizontal speed to carry out this move, and it is also not possible to ledge grab out of a triple jump. Unlike single and double jumps, triple jumps are always the same height. Long Jump  - While Mario is moving, hold Z and press A to long jump. Sideflip  - While Mario is running in any direction, flick the stick in the opposite direction to make Mario start sliding. While Mario is in this sliding state, you can perform a sideflip by tilting the stick in your desired direction and pressing A. Backflip  - While standing still, hold Z and press A to backflip. This technique has very few applications in an RTA run, but the most common use is on the  Advanced CCM Wall Kicks Will Work  strategy. Walljump/Wallkick  - While Mario has forwards momentum and is within approximately 45\u00b0 of a vertical wall, he can perform a wallkick. When you get close to the wall, press A to wallkick. There are 5 frames in which Mario is able to wallkick, and each frame is slightly different. The most notable wallkick first-frame wallkick, also known as a firstie/firsty where Mario will gain speed out of the wallkick. On 2nd through 5th-frame wallkicks Mario loses some height each frame. Punch  - While standing still on the ground or with low forward momentum, press B to punch.  Pressing B while crawling, or pressing B with high horizontal high speed while holding neutral on the stick will also perform a punch. Kick (on ground)  - While standing still on the ground or with low forward momentum with the A button held, press B to do a kick. Kick (in air)  - While in the air with little to no forward momentum, press B to kick. Dive  - While grounded or in the air with a lot of forward momentum, press B to dive. Being able to perform a kick or dive in specific parts of the game requires some effort. A common point of failure among beginner runners is trying to do double jump kicks in Bowser in the Sky. This is great movement to practice to get a feel for how to kick versus how to dive. Dive Recover/Rollout  - While Mario is in the dive animation and hits the floor, you can press either A or B to roll out of the dive. Some players slide their finger from A to B (for two chances) to try and make the rollout dustless. When doing long jumps, dive recovers, and slide kick rollouts you have a large window to hit the next movement. Dustless rollouts can be performed on the first possible frame. If performed correctly, no dust will be generated under Mario, hence the name dustless. Mario does not lose any speed with dustless movements. If you roll out over an edge, Mario will be in a state where he does not take damage, but cannot ledge grab, kick, wallkick, or ground pound. Slide Kick  - While Mario has forward momentum, hold Z and press the B button to perform a slide kick. Slide kicks have the property of quick startup, so it is preferred in very specific instances. One common spot is when going to talk to the penguin inside the CCM slide area. Ground Pound  - While Mario is in the air in a jumping or falling state, you can hit Z to ground pound. It is very common to ground pound under stars, since it extends Mario's hitbox upwards and he falls down faster after grabbing the star. The same thing applies to breaking boxes to grab stars. If you hit A+Z on the same frame while grounded, Mario will ground pound. Mistakes often occur during speedruns when the runner attempts to long jump but instead ground pounds. Ledge Grab  - Mario can grab a ledge out of any state with 3 exceptions. You cannot ledge grab if you are in a dive recover state, on a steep slope, or in a triple jump. This is why players often chain a triple jump with a wallkick so they can ledge grab. Swimming  - Press A to swim. Maximum swimming Fspeed is 28 and falls to 26 before the next A press. Optimal swimming is on a 20 frame cycle; there are 13 frames where pressing A will be too early and do nothing, then 7 frames where pressing A will result in maximum speed, and beyond that pressing A will result in slower swimming speed. Regardless of when the A button is pressed in the 7 frame window, this 20 frame cycle will repeat. Flying  - To start flying, Mario must have a Wing Cap equipped and perform a triple jump. This triple jump is unique, since it can be done in place, whereas a regular triple jump cannot. A good general practice while flying is to try and make smooth parabolic arcs to retain your speed. If you are falling or ground pounding with the Wing Cap on, you can hold A to fall slower. Crawling  - While standing still, holding Z and a direction on the stick will make Mario crawl.

Continue Dismiss https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/File:Box_gp_delay.mp4     You can save a few frames by delaying your groundpounds under star boxes. Immediate Jumps on slopes  - While Mario is on a slope with the Z button held, you can instantly jump or jumpdive much faster than if you were not. This is useful for  Whomp's Fortress 100 Coin ,  Lethal Lava Land  movement, and  Tall Tall Mountain reds . Twirling  - When Mario bounces off a Spindrift or Fly Guy, or gets sucked into a tornado in Shifting Sand Land, he enters a twirling state. While in this state, you can hold A to make Mario spin faster and cover more ground as he descends. When landing on an enemy (such as the  bird star  in SSL), holding neutral while bouncing conserves your horizontal speed and direction until you move the stick again. Pole Grab  - When you grab the bottom of a pole, Mario will try to catch it but fail most of the time. If you mash B, he will keep trying to regrab the pole instead of falling off of it. You will see this a lot when runners try to do  Lakitu Bounce  in Rainbow Ride or grab the pole in  Bowser in the Sky Reds . Quick Turn  - When holding neutral while landing (e.g. from a rollout), Mario will lose all momentum and perform a quick-stop animation. By inputting a direction on the stick during this quick-stop animation, Mario will begin to move, cancelling the quick-stop animation. Once Mario's speed returns to zero, the next directional input will be a quick turn, and Mario will instantly face the direction you input. Speedkick  - This is probably the most difficult movement option in the game. At a high level, you speedkick to maintain your speed and get a specific amount of spacing into some other movement option like a triple jump wallkick or a jump dive. To do a speedkick, Mario must be moving. Before he makes contact with the ground, you must be holding A and the control stick must be slightly tilted in the direction you want to speedkick. If you've played any Super Smash Bros. games before, it is similar to performing tilts instead of smash attacks. Finally, when Mario hits the ground, hit B to speedkick.

Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Camera Mechanics Though it may seem unintuitive at first, using different camera angles can be very helpful for a wide variety of movement throughout the game. Manipulating the camera is also a key part of lag reduction. Play around with the camera modes and see what works best. When watching the videos on this site, make sure to pay attention to the cameras that are being used. It is not always easy to implement right when you start learning, but it is good to be aware of them. Lakitu Cam  - Lakitu Cam has fixed rotations in most stages. The clearest example of this is in Bowser secret stages, which are widely open and Lakitu can move freely. This is very useful to perform specific movements or tricks in the game because you can guarantee the same angle every time. In other stages, like Bob-Omb Battlefield, Lakitu Cam acts more unpredictably due to the camera colliding with walls as Mario moves around. If you double tap the R button, the camera refocuses at the original distance from Mario. When falling large distances, this is useful to get the camera behind Mario again instead of waiting for it to catch up to him. Common examples of this are in  CCM 100 coins  or  Wall Kicks Will Work  when you intentionally fall to the bottom of the stage. Mario Cam  - Mario Cam is best described as directly following behind Mario. When using Mario Cam, it is most often used in the C-down version. In places where Lakitu Cam fails to turn or follow well, Mario Cam is often used to see better. Mario Cam is also very helpful for setting specific angles upon stage entry. Some common stars to use this for are at the start of CCM 100 to grab the first red and LLL to enter the volcano. Castle Cam  - For lack of a better term, the camera gets fixed to certain viewpoints for some areas. Most notably, inside the castle lobby and inside the mansion for Big Boo's Haunt. In these areas, you can switch between Lakitu Cam and Mario cam, but lose the functionality of using the C-down versions of these. In BBH however, if you enter the mansion in Mario Cam C-down, that camera will persist as long as you do not switch back to Lakitu Cam (This is useful for a number of stars in BBH). This is not an option for the lobby, since when you enter, you are changing loading zones. Underwater Cam  - When swimming, the camera will always follow behind Mario. The only difference between Mario Cam and Lakitu Cam for swimming is how close the camera is to Mario. If you need to use specific cameras while swimming (to lag reduce or swim through rings), you have to hold the C-button for the direction you want the camera to pan for as long as you need it. When you let go, it will pan back to directly behind Mario. Some players prefer to switch to a claw grip on their controller for swimming to make this easier. Tricks VS Movements While it's not always clear cut to distinguish what constitutes a trick and what constitutes movement, we have a common saying in the community. \"Tricks save seconds, movement saves minutes.\" Basically, if you want to optimize your personal best quickly, sinking time into how Mario moves and interacts with different parts of stages will help you gain strong fundamentals. If you focus on specific tricks (pillarless,  lavaboost , lakitu bounce, etc,) the time you spend learning those stars does not really improve your game as a whole. That being said, there are several runners who jumped in the deep end (reset over every failed trick until they became consistent) and still made it to the top. Pick what best works for you and make sure you are having fun with the game. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e RTA Guide Platforms Nintendo 64  \u2022  Virtual Console  \u2022  Emulator Categories 0/1 Star  \u2022  16 Star  \u2022  70 Star  \u2022  120 Star  \u2022  31 Star  \u2022  50 Star  \u2022  All\u00a0!

The 1st star must be selected when entering the stage in order to spawn this star. Your speed is capped while you're spinning. If you land on the fly-guy while holding neutral, you'll maintain your speed until the moment you make another input.   Try to run on the right side of the pillar. If you run too far left, fly-guy will move towards you and ruin the setup.

Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Advanced (Front Pillar Single Jump/Punch) Doing two single jumps after rolling out at the bottom of the slope allows you to preserve speed on your way to the pillar. The first single jump should be frame-perfect, but if you're a couple frames late on the second jump you can still just walk up the pillar normally. Load video YouTube YouTube might collect personal data.  Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Doing two first-frame punches allows you to conserve slightly more speed than is possible with the single jumps. However, this is riskier than the doing the single jumps because failing to punch on the first frame possible will cause you to lose most or all of your speed immediately.

Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Expert (Flyguyless)   Ideally, doing two jumpkicks before the jumpdive on the side of pyramid is faster, but some runners will opt to do three jumpkicks instead. This strat requires you to do a frame-perfect rollout after sliding down the slope, and then doing a frame perfect slidekick to get to the far pillar. Then, a camera setup is helpful in giving you a good angle to long jump with from the pillar that will allow you to jump-kick up the side of the pyramid and then jump-dive on to the platform. This is only recommended for top-level 16 star runners. Load video YouTube YouTube might collect personal data.

{"prompt": "Explain Mario's Platform Adventure", "completion": "Mario's Platform Adventure  or  MPA [1]  is a trick where the  controllable platform  in  Hazy Maze Cave  can be clipped out of bounds, allowing the transport of enemies. Explication When the controllable platform hits a wall, it will stop and then starts moving in the other direction. However, it will still clip into the wall for a single frame. The controllable platform also has a anti-spam timer to prevent us from constantly reactivating it, but it can be bypassed by rapidly alternating between two buttons. Since pressing another button instantly resets Mario's ability to control the platform, it is possible to keep alternating between them in a corner in order to clip the platform out of bounds. Application HMC is an example of a level that uses rooms. Each room is an area, typically separated from other areas by doors. Each enemy \u201cbelongs\u201d to the room it\u2019s in. Mario also has a current room, determined by the last solid floor he was above. If Mario is not in a given enemy\u2019s room, it is frozen in place and made invisible. The red platform acts as if it belongs to Mario\u2019s current room. Furthermore, Mario\u2019s current room doesn\u2019t change until he moves over solid ground again. This means that we can use it to transport enemies through out-of-bounds to anywhere in the level, so long as: We can get the platform out of bounds. We can get Mario out of bounds, on the platform.

{"prompt": "Explain Shell Mario", "completion": "Shell Mario in  Tiny-Huge Island The  Shell Mario  glitch is a phenomenon where a Koopa shell is in the state of being ridden normally, but Mario is not. This allows Mario to receive a constant push from the shell's  hitbox , similar to a  Bloated Bob-omb , but still have access to most actions such as jumping, side-flipping, swimming, etc. Also similar to a Bloated Bob-omb, speed values are not affected. The Shell Mario glitch is canceled by: Walking Receiving knockback Catching fire Entering a cannon Entering vertical wind Twirling Being grabbed Shell Mario glitch can only be performed in  Tiny-Huge Island [1]  and  Snowman's Land . [2] The shell hitbox pushes Mario 89 units forward every frame. Execution To enter Shell Mario, a Koopa shell must be positioned in shallow water so that Mario can touch the shell and enter the \"in water\" action on the same frame. A method of entering Shell Mario also exists that involves colliding with out of bounds while riding a shell and entering water, though the specific process is unknown. The same process can also be performed with a shell clone, albeit without the pushing effect.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Lethal Lava Land)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way. No Joystick Allowed The 100 coin star is currently used to reset Mario's ascent of steep slopes, which is useful near the top of the pyramid in  Shifting Sand Land  to collect the stars  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  and  Pyramid Puzzle .

Because the A button makes Mario jump, great creativity and precision are required to progress in the game without using this \"vital\" function. The ABC is often connected to the discoveries of new glitches and techniques that can be used more generally throughout the game. Much of the material on the  pannenkoek2012  and  UncommentatedPannen  channels is related to the A Button Challenge, with only 13 remaining A presses (10 unique A presses) left to optimize. [1] Contents 1   History 2   A Presses Left 3   Version Differences 4   References History Main article:  History of the A Button Challenge Although much of the progress in the ABC has been made since 2013, the ABC existed for over a decade earlier. Pieces of what would become the ABC were present in different terms, as early as 2001 on Walton Dell's site on multiple level pages. [2]  Curtis Bright, who runs sm64.com, was keeping track of ABC at least as early as December of 2006. [3]  Thiago Trujillo had what is the earliest, nearly complete count for the game (that we have access to) with a total count of about 263 presses. [4]  (This list is missing all navigation presses, two of the  DDD  stars, three of the  TTC  stars, one star in  RR , and  BitS .) Pannenkoek's first ABC video was for 5 Itty Bitty Secrets, and was released in August 2013. [5]  The count at this point was about 212 presses, although this number dropped fairly quickly. Within the first 4 months, the count had fallen nearly 100 presses, and was down to 118. Over the next five years, many different people have worked on removing as many A presses as possible, and the number has dropped to only 13 A presses in a 120 star run, as well as 0 in any% on WiiVC. A Presses Left A  unique A press  refers to a single circumstance under which the A button must be pressed during a run. This circumstance may occur multiple times, leading to multiple A presses; if a workaround is found for the unique A press, all of those individual A presses may be saved. For example, if entering a course requires an A press, the case of entering the course is a unique A press, even if said course must be visited multiple times over the course of a run. Below is a table of unique A presses in the A Button Challenge.

These presses can be held from earlier presses to lower counts in longer runs, but still count as a full press on single-star runs. Such A presses are referred to as \"half A presses,\" and result in A press counts such as 2.5 [6] . Note that only one half A press can be required per star.

{"prompt": "Explain Koopa the Quick - Glitches", "completion": "Koopa the Quick Technical Constants Object Group Pushable Physical Constants Gravity 4 Friction 10 Hitbox Radius 180 Height 300 Koopa the Quick  is an NPC Koopa Mario can talk to and race in  Bob-omb Battlefield  and  Tiny-Huge Island . Koopa the Quick only appears on his specific missions, being  Footrace with Koopa the Quick  and  Rematch with Koopa the Quick .  Glitches When Koopa the Quick interacts with a  bowling ball  coming toward him, he will jump over it. Similarly, when Koopa the Quick interacts with a bowling ball moving away from him, he'll slow down for it. Using Bowling Ball  clones , it is possible to manipulate Koopa the Quick. By placing a clone of a bowling ball facing toward him in certain spots, Mario can make him jump into cannons and chasms. By placing a clone facing away from him, Mario can make him slow down at will. By slowing him down with a clone, Koopa the Quick will begin to walk backwards, causing his animation to move into the negatives and display glitchy animations. Placing both a clone facing toward him and away from him can cause him to jump infinitely. [1]  This can be exploited to send him to parallel universes.

{"prompt": "Explain Game Freeze", "completion": "A  Crash ,  Freeze , or  Hardlock  is when the  game thread  of SM64 stops executing instructions (as opposed to a  softlock , where the game is still running as normal but is stuck in a loop without any way to get out). Crashes can occur in several different ways, such as a game thread exception or an  RCP  (graphics) crash. Contents 1   CPU Crashes 2   RCP (Graphics) Crashes 3   See Also 4   References CPU Crashes Cause Exception Type Notes Exceed the  object limit N/A This is technically not a crash as the game developers accounted for this scenario and made the game enter an infinite loop. However, this infinite loop has the same symptoms as a crash and is one for all practical purposes, so it is included here. This \"crash\" can be done via a variety of methods including cloning, hat duplication, monty-mole pellet build-up, or money-bag duplication. Sending the camera into a  PU Floating-Point Overflow Walking at PU speed for only a portion of the 4 quarter steps on a  frame Floating-Point Overflow Moving at PU speed with no joystick input for all 4 quarter steps on a frame Floating-Point Overflow Moving 16384 distance into a wall (Often a PU Crash) Floating-Point Overflow Walking with a speed greater than or equal to 2^31 / 170 (~12.632M) Floating-Point Overflow Mario's speed is multiplied by 170 in some intermediate calculations and casted to an int. When this cast exceeds 2^31 an FPE occurs. Turning during a walking action such that speed times change in yaw is greater than or equal to 2^31 * 12 (~12.583M with dyaw = 2048) Floating-Point Overflow Similar to the above. Bully Knockback Division-by-Zero Floating-Point Division-by-Zero By positioning Mario at the exact same X and Z coordinates as the bully, a division-by-zero exception occurs when the game divides by the lateral distance between Mario and the bully to calculate Mario and the bully's new speed after the collision. [1] Bully/Bob-omb Angle Overflow Floating-Point Overflow When a Bully or Bob-omb is out-of-bounds, the code to keep their angle between -32768 and 32767 doesn't run, and eventually it becomes big enough that a floating-point overflow exception occurs when casted back to an int. [2] [3] Deleting a non-existent file on the File Select Screen [4] Address Error The game tries to find the button object corresponding to the file and set its state to erased. However, the button object doesn't exist (a New File button is there instead), so it ends up trying to write to NULL. Moving a shadow above  surface  12 while it's over OOB Address Error The surface SURFACE_INTANGIBLE (surface 12) has the special property that in some cases find_floor will look for floors below an intangible surface if it finds one. If there's no floor below the intangible surface, find_floor will return NULL for the found floor but the height of the intangible floor. As floors are null-checked by checking if their height is the default value of -11000, this will cause a NULL dereference the next time the game tries to use the floor variable. Killing a Monty Mole remotely Address Error The game tries to find which hole the Monty Mole should spawn in, but all the available holes are too far away from Mario, so no hole is chosen and the Monty Mole tries to go to a null hole. [5] Killing an uninitialized Monty Mole [6] Address Error Similar to above. Going out of bounds in a room with a painting Address Error Paintings use the floor type of Mario's floor to decide how they should ripple. Going out-of-bounds causes them to try to read the floor type of null. Being pushed off of a hangable  ceiling  while hanging and stationary without another ceiling above Address Error The game has a check to make Mario enter freefall if the ceiling above him is not hangable. The programmers failed to account for the ceiling being NULL, so if Mario is pushed off the ceiling and has no ceiling above him the game will try to read the type of a null ceiling and crash. Sound glitch Unknown \"Sound glitch\" refers to when the audio thread encounters an exception (usually an address error exception), therefore causing the sound to cut out. When the game thread next tries to interface with the audio thread on a level load, the game thread crashes as well. Sound glitch is often treated as one singular glitch even though it is really a class of glitches in the audio library. Sound glitches are usually J-exclusive, however some instances such as the  BitS  sound glitch are not. Teleporting while passing over a loading zone Address Error Since the area changed, there is now no teleporter with the same ID as the one Mario used to warp. Thus the game returns NULL when trying to find an associated warp node to warp to, and crashes when trying to access information about its destination. Under certain conditions, this can cause a Wrong Warp on PAL or Shindou VC. Warping out of a level while passing over a loading zone Address Error Similar to above, but only hypothetical. Maybe possible in DDD using the Sub Gate warp and whirlpool cloning to reach the instant loading zone, but not yet achieved without hacks. Entering Wiggler's Cave on the Disk Drive version Floating-Point Unimplemented Operation When Wiggler is initialized, his health value is 2048 for a single frame before being reset to 4. Wiggler uses his health to index into a table to get his speed (to move faster when at lower health); 2048 causes it to index out of range and read a denormalized floating-point number as his health, which causes an unimplemented operation exception since the N64 does not implement any operations on denormalized floats except comparisons. Having an object too far away from the camera make a noise (JP only) Floating-Point Unimplemented Operation When a noise's pan is determined, it uses the position of the object to calculate the pan. When the object's absolute z-position relative to the camera is large (>= 22000 units) and the x-position relative to the camera is very negative (< -66000), an index for the pan will be generated outside of the bounds of the array for the pan. When the value outside of the array is an invalid float, the audio thread will crash (sound glitch). Does not happen when sound mode is set to Mono. Casting a shadow on a corrupted triangle Floating-Point Unimplemented Operation The limit of surface triangle loaded at once in the game is 2300. However, in  Hazy Maze Cave , when using  Mario's Platform Adventure , it is possible to load more triangle than this limit. This causes the surfaceList to overwrite part of the face table. If the game tries to cast a shadow on one of the \"triangles\" created by this situation, the normalX of the triangle will be a pointer and be processed as a denormalized float, which crashes the game when used for arithmethic. [7] Having the same position as the camera's position Floating-Point Division-by-Zero When Mario stands in the same position as the camera, the game will crash due to a division by zero error. [8] Rotating a Pendulum using pendulum manipulation beyond the float angle limit. Floating-Point Overflow Manipulating the pendulum to rotate beyond the range of an int will error when truncating the float. Verification of this crash took 39 days. [9] Touching a recovery heart with more than ~10.7M speed. Floating-Point Overflow Touching a recovery heart with more than ~10.7M speed will cause float-to-int conversion with a float value that's greater than the max integer value. [10] RCP (Graphics) Crashes Cause Exception Type Notes Have too many 3D models on screen at once Invalid F3D command The main display list buffer has two sides, the left side holds F3D commands the game runs, and the right side holds allocated buffers for matrices. When an object's graphics are drawn, 16 bytes are used from the left side and 64 from the right side for each separate 3D model from the object. These two sides overlap when there are too many of these models on screen, leading to both sides being overwritten with garbage data and invalid F3D commands. Moving the camera immediately when entering  VCutM Invalid F3D command The object that spawns the rotating checkerboard platforms in VCutM references a model that doesn't exist. Normally this isn't a problem, since it's not on screen so it's culled before any damage occurs, and it despawns 1 frame after loading the level. However rotating the camera on the first frame, right before it despawns, it just barely comes into view. The non-existent model ends up sending invalid F3D commands to the RCP.

Specifically, a double jump can be entered by pressing A while in: A  Single Jump Land A  Sideflip Land A  Freefall Land Transition In See  single jump  for more details If Mario is squished and/or has a quicksand depth more than 1, cancel to  Single Jump . (This cancel is shared with  Twirling ) [1] Mario's vertical speed is set to  52 + hspeed 4 {\\displaystyle 52+{\\frac {\\text{hspeed}}{4}}} . Mario's forward velocity is multiplied by 0.8 Behavior As with all airborne actions, a variety of \"cancels\" are checked prior to actually performing the jump action. See  Single Jump#Airborne cancels At this point, two more things happen prior to the jump action: Mario's quicksand depth is set to 0. Mario plays a falling noise if he has fallen more than 1150 units from his peak. With the jump action occurring, the following happens: If Mario's vertical speed is not negative, his animation is set to the double jump rising animation. Otherwise, it is set to the double jump falling animation. If the B button is pressed, Mario will either enter the  dive  action if his speed is greater than 28 or the  jump kick  action otherwise. If the Z button is pressed, Mario will enter the  ground pound  action. Mario performs the other noises for the jump. Now, Mario performs the quarter-frame movement via a full  common air step . The landing action is a  double jump land  action and the check has both the \"Check Ledge Grab\" and \"Check Hang\" flags.

They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way. No Joystick Allowed The 100 coin star is currently used to reset Mario's ascent of steep slopes, which is useful near the top of the pyramid in  Shifting Sand Land  to collect the stars  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  and  Pyramid Puzzle .

{"prompt": "Explain Fall damage", "completion": "Fall Damage  is damage caused by falling from a high height. There are two types of fall damage:  Small Fall Damage  and  Large Fall Damage . Small fall damage usually occurs whenever Mario's falling faster than 55 units per frame (i.e. he has lower than -55  vertical speed ) and has fallen more than 1150 units from his peak height (the highest height he reached since he last became airborne). Large fall damage usually occurs when Mario is falling faster than 55 units per frame and has fallen more than 3000 units from his peak height. Under some circumstances, Mario will not take fall damage, such as in certain terrain with a relatively steep slope, or when landing on snow, sand (both of these provided you don't dive with Mario facing flat [1] ), and lava. Mario also does not take fall damage if he is twirling. A condition exists within the game for Mario to take damage starting at Mario falling 600 units from his peak height, but this condition is never met in-game . The damage received from each type of fall damage is as follows: 2 sections for small fall damage, 4 sections for large fall damage, and without a hat, these values become 3 and 6 sections respectively. Taking small fall damage also squishes Mario for 30 frames. If Mario is holding something and takes large fall damage, he will drop what he is holding. This can be used to perform  Instant Release .

{"prompt": "Explain Light Grabbing", "completion": "This article is in need of an image. You can help Ukikipedia by  adding images . Light Grabbing  is a glitch that allows grabbable objects of the heavy weight class to be grabbed light, which allows Mario to jump and run while holding them. It applies to both  Chuckya  and  King Bob-omb , although not all method will be possible on all objects in vanilla. There exist three ways to grab an heavy object light: A water grab, a ledge grab and triggering a textbox while holding an heavy object. Contents 1   Water Grab 2   Edge Grab 3   Light Grab via Text 4   References Water Grab When grabbing an object with a water grab, the game doesn't check for the weight of the object, the result is always a light grab. In theory, Mario is not supposed to be able to water grab Chuckya or King Bob-omb, but this can be accomplished in  Wet-Dry World  with precise timing. Edge Grab It is possible to grab both Chuckya and King Bob-omb using an edge grab. To achieve this, Chuckya must be close to an edge and Mario must be facing in a way that he will be airborne in the first 3 frames of a punch, but that his punch will be in the object's grabbable area. When Mario starts his punch, the game will check whether he is in the correct action to grab the object in front of him and set a flag accordingly. The only valid action for an heavy object is a punch, while diving and punching are both valid actions for light object.  If Mario then becomes airborne, he can dive on the first frame while the flag is still active, allowing Mario to pick up the heavy object from a dive. Since a dive cannot normally hold an heavy object, it defaults to putting Mario in the light object state. [1] Light Grab via Text   Mario getting light Chuckya via the monkey's textbox If Mario holds a heavy object and triggers a textbox, he will be put in the Standing with object action, effectively making the object light. [2]  This is because the cutscene action sets Mario's animation, and will always put him in the light animation, no matter the weight of the object he holds.

Bullies attack by running in to Mario, knocking him back. They can be defeated by knocking them into lava. The regular Bully model is loaded in actor group 2, while the Chill Bully model is loaded in with actor group 16. Contents 1   Locations 2   Use in Challenges 3   Bully Crashes 3.1   Angle Conversion Crash 3.2   Divide by 0 Crash 4   References Locations The following courses have Bullies: Lethal Lava Land Bowser in the Fire Sea Snowman's Land Use in Challenges An application of the  Bully Battery  glitch has been used to complete  Elevator Tour in the Volcano  in 0 A-presses and has been suggested as a possible method for getting past the Bowser in the Fire Sea pole in 0 A-presses on N64. Bullies have also seen minor use in other challenges, such as doing Bowser in the Fire Sea with no joystick. Bully Crashes Angle Conversion Crash Normally, a Bully's angle is confined to the range [-32768, 32767]. However, this code does not occur if the Bully is out-of-bounds. Due to this oversight, if Mario knocks a Bully out-of-bounds, its angle will increase by 32767 every frame without bound. After approximately 36 minutes, the Bully's angle exceeds the hex value 0x7FFFFFFF (2,147,483,647) at which point the game will crash from trying to perform a double-to-int conversion on a value above 0x7FFFFFFF. This crash does not occur on emulators, except for Wii VC, where the bully will keep moving on one axis, all the way out of the map.  Divide by 0 Crash The Bully enemy's knockback logic contains a step that involves dividing by the horizontal distance between Mario and the Bully. Thus, the game will crash from a divide by 0 error if the operation is performed while the distance between Mario and the Bully is 0. Causing this crash requires very specific conditions. Mario must be next to an area out-of-bounds so that he will not be moved away from the bully before the crash can occur and Mario must be in a state to receive knockback from the bully, making the exact movement needed to cause the crash very precise.

Position Most stars spawn with coordinates that are divisible by 100, although 100 Coin Stars can spawn anywhere. Some stars are always loaded, while some (such as  Red Coin Stars  and  Secret Stars ) load during the level at a  Star Spawner . Yaw Velocity (Angular Speed) Power Stars spawned from a  ! Block  have a yaw velocity of 1024  angle units  per  frame  (168.75 deg/s). All other Power Stars have a yaw velocity of 2048 angle units per frame (337.5 deg/s). This is because the Power Stars have different behaviors. All Power Stars spin counterclockwise when viewed from above, similarly to a globe. Storage in memory This article is a  stub . As such, it is not complete. You can help Ukikipedia by  expanding it . Power Stars are stored such that it is impossible to collect more than 120 stars by collecting two of the same star, even if both are yellow.

Entering Dire Dire Docks  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/mlHzqJn2SMs?t=2m24s   Since the painting is very large, walking into it will suffice and it is not required to dive. Board Bowser's Sub  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/4JEoBwuXkzQ   The main problem is ascending to Bowser's submarine since Mario cannot climb up to it from the water. However, a technique known as  207 Dive Recover  can be used to ascend from the cork boxes using the  misalignment , a 1-unit region where Mario cannot be pushed out by the walls and can snap onto the floor above. Using this technique, Mario can board Bowser's sub and collect the star. Chests in the Current  (0x) Video 1 (main strategy):  https://youtu.be/WXXR-cwhW9w   Video 2 (alternative, faster strat):  https://youtu.be/cTNlkmiGNRw   Mario can collect the star by opening the chest in the correct order. The main problem is opening the 4th chest, which is very close to the underwater vortex and can only be escaped with enough speed (10 using precise movements). Using underwater grabbing (with precise B presses), Mario can only go up to 7 speed, so Pannenkoek first grabs an underwater shell on the other side of the tunnel to conserve 16 speed, allowing Mario to escape the current when opening chests. Eventually, Pannekoek figures out an alternative, quicker method involving  Hyper Speed Walking  on the slippery slopes at the surface of the course, allowing Mario to build up to 50 speed and convert it to 11 swimming speed. This is barely enough to escape the vortex after the fourth chest is opened. Pole-Jumping for Red Coins  (0.5x) Main article:  Pole-Jumping for Red Coins Video:  https://youtu.be/gvQMNQlgu3s   The main challenge is collecting the two red coins behind the red walls and the one lone coin in the cage. The 0.5 A press is used for swimming in water with an object, as Mario needs to hold a shell through the loading zone. For the two coins behind the red walls, Mario clones a pole directly between two widely-separated poles for Mario to get across. For the caged red coin, the HOLP with a dummy clone at a specific location for cloning a whirlpool clone to exploit the \"no transition loading glitch\". The transition loading is a procedure the game uses to create an illusion for two connected areas. Normally, the loading point would translate Mario's position by 8192 units to fit in the new coordinates system of the new area, but a failsafe mechanism exists to reject the translation if Mario's new position would be out of bounds. By placing a whirlpool clone into a position out of bounds, Mario can avoid the loading point translation by being pulled by the whirlpool clone through the wall and triggering the loading point at the same frame. As the new area loads, Mario begins to spiral, not around the whirlpool, but the newly loaded cork box replacing the whirlpool clone. He is then able to escape from the whirlpool death as the spiraling path grazes on a platform Mario can stand on, conveniently close to where the caged red coin is. Through the Jet Stream  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/2kayePVdnw8   Previously, Pannenkoek uses 0.5 A presses (holding out the previous A) to collect the star by either cloning a pole to access the caps or use loading point cloning without the Metal Cap, as accessing the caps requires A presses to reach. However, the 207 dive recover strategy allowing ascending the cork boxes was soon discovered, allowing Mario to use the Metal Cap with 0 A presses. Mario simply swims through the 5 aqua rings and collect the star by using a metal cap. Unlike the star in Jolly Roger Bay, this star is close enough to the ground for Metal Mario to pick it up by walking into it underwater. The Manta Ray's Reward  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/EHcih_XvYTM   Due to low swimming speed without A presses, Mario has to preemptively go in front of the manta ray and follow the rings. Other than that, the stage is simple to complete. Collect the Caps\u2026  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/pYTzVFC0Qoo   Mario needs to use the 207 dive recover trick twice, first to collect the vanish cap, and then collect the metal cap. Mario would then have enough speed to drop down into the water while retaining invisibility to enter the cage. Mario then swims upwards to collect the star. This takes the advantage from the fact that the vanish cap timer (20 seconds) resets while grabbing the metal cap, allowing the vanish cap to last long enough. DDD 100 coins  (0.5x) Video:  https://youtu.be/vkHU_IFmvoQ   As the coin count of the course is 106, 30 of which is from the blue coin block inaccessible without A presses and 16 of which is from red coins, there are only 60 yellow coins that can be collected. Fortunately, there are many coin spawners of 8 that Mario can use to clone since there is a loading point in the course. Therefore, Mario can get infinite coins by \"coin spawner cloning\". The process is estimated to take 25 minutes. Since cloning is involved, Mario needs to hold down A in order to swim with an object held. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge , where  Collect the Caps...  must be cloned with the water shell, and  Through the Jet Stream  requires efficient swimming. In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected, as they all require swimming. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected, as Mario cannot turn in the water. Note that when entering the level, Mario's angle doesn't face the tunnel. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses.  100 Coins  requires coin spawner cloning to avoid ground pounding the  Blue Coin  block. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Board Bowser's Sub ,  Chests in the Current , and  Collect the Caps...  can be collected. The latter requires  Hyperspeed Wall Kicking  to go behind the wall. In the  Floor is Lava Challenge , every star except for  100 Coins  can be collected, as Mario starts the level in the water.  100 Coins  is impossible because it either requires ground pounding the Blue Coin block and landing on the ground, or using coin spawner cloning, which requires walking out of the water. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to reach a  Parallel Universe  in the starting area.

These coins have twice the coin value of a normal coin, and appear in groups of eight in every normal and hidden course in the vanilla game (excluding  Peach's Secret Slide ). When the eighth Red Coin is collected, a red coin star has a four-frame delay before it spawns at the  star marker . Note that spawning a  100 Coin Star  has no delay. Behavior When a red coin spawns, it checks for the nearest normal hidden red coin star and sets that to its parent if it exists. If none were found, it looks for the nearest Bowser hidden red coin star and sets that as its parent instead. If both of these checks fail, its parent is set to NULL. After setting its parent object, the object is given its hitbox. From here, the coin's only behavior is to respond interaction from Mario. If it is interacted, it will firstly increment it's parent coin count as long as its parent is not NULL. On the Japanese version, it will spawn a normal coin collection sound at this point. In both the US and JP version, it next spawns an  orange number  as long as the coin is not the eighth collected (More specifically, is not the coin which would normally trigger a star. It is possible to have more than eight coins in a hacked ROM). On the US version, it now instead spawns its sound, which increments its pitch for every red coin collected. The coin finishes by spawning coin sparkles and despawning. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Objects Enemies Regular Amp  \u2022  Bob-omb  \u2022  Boo  \u2022  Bookend  \u2022  Bomp  \u2022  Bub   \u2022  Bubba  \u2022  Bullet Bill  \u2022  Bully  \u2022  Chain Chomp  \u2022  Chuckya  \u2022  Fly Guy  \u2022  Goomba  \u2022  Grindel  \u2022  Haunted Chair  \u2022  Heave-Ho  \u2022  Klepto  \u2022  Koopa  \u2022  Lakitu  \u2022  Mad Piano  \u2022  Moneybag  \u2022  Monty Mole  \u2022  Mr. Blizzard  \u2022  Mr. I  \u2022  Piranha Plant  \u2022  Fire Piranha Plant  \u2022  Pokey  \u2022  Scuttlebug  \u2022  Skeeter  \u2022  Snufit  \u2022  Spindel  \u2022  Spindrift  \u2022  Spiny  \u2022  Sushi  \u2022  Swoop  \u2022  Thwomp  \u2022  Tox Box  \u2022  Unagi  \u2022  Whomp Bosses King Bob-omb  \u2022   Big Boo  \u2022   Big Bully  \u2022  Bowser  \u2022  Eyerok  \u2022  Manta Ray  \u2022  Whomp King  \u2022  Wiggler NPCs Bob-omb Buddy  \u2022  Koopa the Quick  \u2022  Penguin  \u2022  Hoot  \u2022  MIPS  \u2022  Toad  \u2022  Ukiki  \u2022  Yoshi Other Objects Common Yellow Coin  \u2022  Blue Coin  \u2022  Red Coin  \u2022  1-Up Mushroom  \u2022  Bowling Ball  \u2022  Cannon  \u2022  Power Star  \u2022  Seesaw platforms  \u2022  Wing Cap  \u2022  Vanish Cap  \u2022  Metal Cap  \u2022  Elevator  \u2022  Sign  \u2022  Wooden post  \u2022  Cork Box  \u2022  Crazy Box  \u2022  Teleporter  \u2022  Warp Pipe  \u2022  Secret Level Specific Big Boo's Haunt tilting platform  \u2022  Merry-Go-Round  \u2022  Treadmill  \u2022  Pendulum  \u2022  Spinner  \u2022  Bowser Bomb  \u2022  Bowser key  \u2022  Grand Star  \u2022  Lethal Lava Land Drawbridge  \u2022  Tilted Inverted Pyramid Platform  \u2022  BitDW Trapdoor  \u2022  Controllable Platform  \u2022  Boulder Unused Boo key  \u2022  Bowser Anchor  \u2022  Fish spawner  \u2022  Trampoline  \u2022"}

{"prompt": "Explain Merry-Go-Round", "completion": "Merry-Go-Round Technical Constants Object Group Surface Actor Group N/A Tangibility Radius 2000 Draw Distance 4000 The  Merry-Go-Round  is an object in the level  Big Boo's Haunt . It features prominently in the star  Ride Big Boo's Merry-Go-Round .  Behavior Before the Big Boo in the mission Ride Big Boo's Merry-Go-Round is defeated, the Merry-Go-Round rotates and plays music if Mario is near it. On the more technical side, the Merry-Go-Round's behavior consists of two functions, one of which is to handle playing music, and the other of which handles the rest of its behavior.  The purpose and outline of the first function is as follows: the game checks whether or not the Merry-Go-Round music should play, plays it if it should, and if not, does not play it and checks whether it should. If the music should not play, the game checks if Mario\u2019s current room is near the Merry-Go-Round. If it is, the game plays the Merry-Go-Round music and BBH music at the same time and sets a variable that the Merry-Go-Round music should play. If the Merry-Go-Round music should play, the game goes through steps to check if it should continue to play. The game gets Mario\u2019s floor and the floor\u2019s surface type. If Mario\u2019s floor is null, the floor type is set to 0. Otherwise, the floor type is obtained directly from Mario\u2019s current floor. Then, the game checks if Mario is on the Merry-Go-Round platform or if Mario\u2019s current floor has type 0x1A (used for the Merry-Go-Round). If either of these conditions are met, the game plays only the Merry-Go-Round music and sets a variable that Mario is on the Merry-Go-Round. Otherwise, the game plays both the Merry-Go-Round and BBH music and the variable for whether Mario is on the Merry-Go-Round is set to false. The game also has a check for whether or not Mario is in the Merry-Go-Round area of the basement. If Mario\u2019s current room is not the Merry-Go-Round room, and his current room is not near the Merry-Go-Round room, the game goes back to playing the BBH music and sets that the Merry-Go-Round music should not play. If this check is not satisfied, the game plays the sound of the Merry-Go-Round creaking.  The Merry-Go-Round\u2019s other function has two purposes: to play the howling wind sound and to move the Merry-Go-Round. The Merry-Go-Round object has an attribute for whether or not Mario is in the outside area of BBH. If this is set to false, the game checks whether Mario is in the outside area or not. If he is, the attribute is set to true. If the attribute is set to true, the sound of howling wind plays. Within the code that occurs when Mario is set to outside, if Mario\u2019s current room is not the outside area of BBH and Mario\u2019s room is not the Merry-Go-Round room, the Merry-Go-Round attribute for whether Mario is outside is set to false. For the movement, if the Merry-Go-Round should not be stopped, the Merry-Go-Rounds Angular Yaw Velocity is set to 128 angular units (.7 degrees), this value is added to the Merry-Go-Round\u2019s moving angle and facing angle every frame, and the Merry-Go-Round music function is run. If the Merry-Go-Round should be stopped, the Angular Yaw Velocity is set to 0 and the music switches back to the BBH music.

{"prompt": "Explain Cloning", "completion": "Mario holding a Coin Clone Cloning  refers to a number of glitches that allow Mario to hold  objects  that were not intended to be held. Typically, this happens when Mario continues to hold an  object slot  after the object in it has unloaded. When a new object loads into this slot, Mario will hold a reference to this new object. The name \"cloning\" comes from one of its main applications, which is to duplicate objects such as  coins  or  goombas . This name is a misnomer, as the duplication behavior is a property of those specific objects, and not the technique itself.    How holding objects works Contents 1   Methods 1.1   Delayed grab 1.2   Loading zones 2   Properties of clones 3   Applications 3.1   Duplication 3.2   Infinite shell 3.3   Remote star collection 4   Manipulating clones 4.1   Coin in BoB 4.2   Coin in BitFS 4.3   Top coin of a ring (AKA coin#3) 4.4   Bob-omb 4.5   Chain Chomp's Pivot 4.6   Red Coin Star 4.7   100 coin star 4.8   Koopa Shell 4.9   Metal Cap 5   Premature Cloning 6   See also 7   References Methods Delayed grab When Mario picks up an object by  punching  (as opposed to  diving  or  water grabbing ), there is a two- frame  window of time in which the object is not placed into  limbo , yet Mario has committed to picking up the object. At the end of this window, Mario will hold the object slot that this object is in, even if the original object has since unloaded. For example, if Mario begins to pick up a  Bob-omb  just before it explodes and unloads, Mario will hold the object slot that the Bob-omb originally occupied. This can be performed using the following objects: [1] Object Circumstances Before coins despawn After coins despawn Bob-omb No fuse VS2 VS3 Early fuse VS4/VS5 VS5/VS6 Full fuse VS2 VS3 Chuckya All VS21 Cork Box Breaking VS42 VS45 Disappearing within no-spawn radius VS1 Disappearing outside no-spawn radius VS2 Crazy Box [2] All VS21 Loading zones Loading zones  cause all objects to unload, and new objects to spawn in their place. If Mario is holding an object while passing through a loading zone, he will continue to hold the object slot, even though the object has unloaded. This can be performed in  Wet-Dry World  by carrying a  chuckya  or  Heave-Ho  through the loading zone, and in  Dire, Dire Docks  using the  water shell holding  glitch. Properties of clones The term \"clone\" generally refers to an object that was not meant to be held that nevertheless is or was being held by Mario. When Mario releases a clone, it stops updating and becomes unable to send signals to other objects. Mario can still  interact  with it, since interaction is part of Mario's behavior, not the object's. For example, while Mario can still collect a coin after it has been cloned, the coin no longer spins. Though Mario can still interact with objects, certain types of interactions will cause the object to become intangible, and thus he will no longer be able to interact with it in any way. These include: Collecting a coin Taking damage from an enemy Touching a  water ring Getting knocked back by a  Bully Touching a  warp  object Getting grabbed by  Chuckya  (or  King Bob-omb , who is impossible to clone) Some notable interactions that do  not  cause the object to become intangible are: Touching a  Koopa Shell Knocking back a Bully Warping using a  Teleporter The behavior of clones is identical to that of objects during  Time Stop . If an object that is meant to be held, like a Bob-omb or cork box, is cloned, it will act normally when released. It is not usually considered a clone and has behavior separate from its behavior during time stop. Applications Duplication Some objects such as  coins  and  Goombas  use  spawners , whose purpose is to ensure that these objects are loaded when necessary. For example, when Mario moves far away from a line of coins, they unload. When Mario again moves toward the coins, the  coin line's spawner  is responsible for respawning the coins, and only those coins, in the line that have not yet been collected. When Mario interacts with a coin, he collects it and sets a flag on the coin spawner to inform it that it has been collected. When the coin next updates, it despawns itself and informs the coin spawner that it should not be respawned when Mario moves away and comes back. However, if this coin was cloned, then it does not update, and so cannot inform the spawner that it has been collected. Thus, if Mario collects a cloned coin, and then moves away and returns, the original coin will respawn, effectively duplicating the coin. This does not occur with coins that do not come from spawners, as they cannot load during the level. The following objects can be duplicated in this manner: Goombas Yellow coins  (not  red coins , as these do not have spawners) Blue coins  by reaching a loading zone before the  Blue Coin Switch  runs out Because cloned objects never unload, they gradually fill up the available  object slots  and continue to be rendered on screen. This can cause lag,  game corruption , and eventually a  game freeze  when the object slots run out. Infinite shell When Mario rides on a  Koopa Shell  or  Shiny Shell , although the latter is impossible to clone, the shell object stays spawned until he runs into a  wall  or presses Z, which causes the shell to break. At this point, Mario sets a flag on the shell, and when the shell next updates, it unloads itself. Because a cloned shell does not update, it does not unload, allowing Mario to repeatedly ride and break a shell after cloning it.  Remote star collection Stars that spawn during the course of gameplay can be cloned. For example, this can be done with red coin stars, 100 coin stars, and stars contained in item boxes. Even if a star is spawned at the start of a level, it can still be cloned if that level contains a  loading zone , such as  Board Bowser's Sub  and  Collect the Caps  in  Dire, Dire Docks . Manipulating clones These are commonly used methods to get Mario to hold the correct  object slot  to clone a desired  object .

This occurs on the first frame a nearby spawner spawns objects that can be cloned, and on that frame, the object would temporarily be placed at the origin of the course (0, 0, 0) while many of the properties are missing. A clone of such an object mimics many of the same traits. Therefore, a premature clone would, if released, be placed at the origin of the course while missing some effects. For example, a coin released prematurely will not be collected while the object is released, unlike the standard steps of cloning a coin. Using this technique, Pannenkoek2012 could complete some stages without collecting any coins where it may seem inevitable, notably in  Mario Wings to the Sky .

{"prompt": "Explain Hangable Ceiling Upwarp", "completion": "An  Upwarp  is a phenomena where Mario's vertical position is suddenly updated so that he appears to warp upward. There are a few types of known upwarps. Tick Tick Clock Upwarp The Tick Tock Clock Upwarp  is an unsolved glitch occurrence where a player named Dota_Teabag encountered an upwarp in  Tick Tock Clock . As of 2023, the glitch remains unsolved. Hangable Ceiling Upwarp The hangable ceiling upwarp is an upwarp caused when Mario single jumps or double jumps into a ceiling at its edge, while under a higher hangable ceiling. This upwarps him to the higher ceiling, and he begins hanging on it.  Water Surface Upwarp Whenever Mario enters water, he is always warped to the surface of the water before he can swim. The upwarp effect is observeable in courses such as WF, TTM, and THI small island. However, a ceiling hitbox can immediately push him back down so that he never remains at the surface of the water. This is observable in WDW in downtown when the water level is overflowed."}

It can be accessed from the painting in the rightmost room of the first floor of Princess Peach's castle. The door leading to it requires at least 3 Power Stars to be opened without a  lobby BLJ . 120 Route Plunder in the Sunken Ship Through the Jet Stream Red Coins on the Ship Afloat + 100 Coins Blast to the Stone Pillar Treasure of the Ocean Cave Can the Eel Come out to Play? Star Select Info There are three versions of the course that can appear by selecting different stars. Keep in mind that if there are any blue stars (uncollected) present in the star selection menu, then the last version that can be selected is the first blue star and not the stars after it. Act 1: Sunken Ship : Accessed by selecting Star 1. The ship is sunken under water, and the eel will be hiding in it. Additionally, there will be fog above the water in this version. Act 2: Surfaced Ship : Accessed by selecting Star 2. The ship is floating at the surface of the water, and the eel is relocated at a hole. Bob-omb Buddy is available to talk to, allowing the cannon to be unlocked. Star 2 and 6 are also now collectable. Act 3: Swimming Eel \u00a0: Accessed by selecting Star 3 through Star 6 only after collecting  Can the Eel Come out to Play? . This is version 2, with the exception that the eel will always be swimming around, without a star on its tail.  It should be avoided in RTA as the eel will cause the game to lag. Tips In order to collect  Red Coins on the Ship Afloat + 100 Coins ,  Through the Jet Stream  or  Can the Eel Come out to Play? , you must first collect  Plunder in the Sunken Ship . In order to collect  Blast to the Stone Pillar , you must first open the cannon in  Red Coins on the Ship Afloat + 100 Coins .

{"prompt": "Explain Hyperspeed Jump Kicking", "completion": "This article is in need of an image. You can help Ukikipedia by  adding images . Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  ( HSJK ) is a  hyperspeed technique  discovered by SilentSlayers where Mario builds up speed by jump kicking repeatedly on a suitable steep slope. Contents 1   Setup 1.1   Corner HSJK 1.2   Low Ceiling HSJK 1.3   Backwards HSJK 2   References Setup In order to perform HSJK, Mario must jump kick and land on a low friction floor, usually with some means of holding him in place. The properties of the slope required for HSJK are the same as for  Hyperspeed Grinding , as both involve the same landing action. However, the conditions required to hold Mario in place during HSJK are more closely related to those for  Backwards Long Jumping  than to those for Hyperspeed Grinding. This is because each jump kick gives Mario positive vertical speed, whereas grinding has strictly non-positive speed. Many HSJK methods require that the landing accelerates Mario, in addition to providing no friction due to the lack of air acceleration. This imposes additional restrictions on the kinds of slopes that can be used, but also makes HSJK usable for building up backwards speed in addition to forwards speed. Corner HSJK The first method of HSJK to be discovered, Corner HSJK involves repeatedly jump kicking into the corner between two walls such that Mario is facing the unreferenced one. This method can theoretically build up to a maximum of roughly ~400 speed before breaking free. [1]  It is the only method in which Mario spends significant time in the air, and as a consequence it cannot build up backwards speed. Low Ceiling HSJK The other basic form of HSJK, Low Ceiling HSJK involves using a  Pedro spot  to hold Mario in place. This method only allows for at most two air acceleration frames per jump kick, and thus requires the floor to accelerate Mario during his landing frames. [2]  The speed that can be obtained this way is limited by the size of the Pedro spot. Backwards HSJK If a floor is steep enough that Mario can slide on it with landing animation to gain sufficiently large speed, then Mario can HSJK on that slope backwards, counteracting the fact he would lose 0.85 speed for every air frame. Hypothesized by Sidney, but it is likely possible given ideal geometry.

{"prompt": "Explain Hyperspeed Walking", "completion": "Hyperspeed Walking  (often abbreviated  HSWing ) is a  hyperspeed glitch  that allows Mario to build up speed while walking in steep slopes submerged in water. It is useful in many  challenges  including the  A Button Challenge . Contents 1   Execution 2   Speed Gained 3   In Challenges 4   References Execution Steep slopes that normally could not be stood on can be stood on when they are submerged in water. If Mario walks uphill or perpendicular to uphill while standing on such a submerged steep slope, then his speed will decrease. There is no lower bound, so Mario can build up unlimited negative speed in this fashion as long as he can remain on the submerged slope. Walls  can keep Mario in place for small amounts of speed, but Mario will eventually break through them.  Ceilings , which usually extend farther than walls and keep Mario in place rather than pushing him, are often more useful. Even better is  Out of Bounds , which keeps Mario in the same place like ceilings do, but extend forever, allowing Mario to build up far more speed. Speed Gained The speed gained by HSWing depends greatly on the normal.y value of the floor in question. On steeper slopes, Mario builds speed significantly faster, used in the faster strat for  Watch for Rolling Rocks 0.5x A presses [1] . However, the  syncing speed  is also greater on these slopes because Mario's  de facto speed  is less. In Challenges HSWing is a common way to build up  Hyperspeed  in  challenges  such as the  A Button Challenge , as it is one of the few ways to access  PUs  without pressing the A Button. It was used in the strategies to enter the  Secret Aquarium  0xA on Virtual Console, and was also used for the  Elevate for 8 Red Coins  0.5xA,  A-Maze-ing Emergency Exit  0.5xA, and  Watch for Rolling Rocks  1xA and 0.5xA strategies, although all of them are now outdated.

{"prompt": "Explain Object adoption", "completion": "A Mr. I Pupil attached to a newly spawned coin using Object Adoption Object Adoption is the process of eliminating a parent object and having a new object load into the parent\u2019s object slot. By doing this, the loaded object is considered the new parent object and can \u201cadopt\u201d the original child object. This has a few interesting applications. Spiny Adoption Spiny Adoption occurs when Spiny\u2019s parent object,  Lakitu , is killed and another object loads into Lakitu\u2019s slot. The Lakitu object contains an attribute stored in object field 0x1B which keeps track of the number of Spinies currently alive. If another object is spawned into Lakitu\u2019s slot, and then the Spiny is killed, it will decrement the new object\u2019s attribute at 0x1B. There are currently two places in the vanilla game where interesting results can occur from this. In  Tiny-Huge Island , there is a Lakitu located near a group of 3 Giant Goombas loaded by a triplet spawner. By performing the adoption on one of these Goombas and despawning the Spiny, the  Goomba  will take on the size value of 0, that of a regular Goomba. This means the Goomba can be killed with a punch, unlike regular giant Goombas. In  Rainbow Ride , if the adoption is done on a Bob-omb respawner, the Bob-omb will respawn with a different model than before. In theory a maximum of 3 decrements of the value are possible, giving a Butterfly, a fish with a shadow, or a fish without a shadow as the Bob-omb's model. Pupil Adoption Pupil Adoption occurs when the Mr. I Pupil\u2019s parent object, Mr. I, is killed and another object loads in its slot before the Pupil updates. Since the pupil considers the new object its parent and is programmed to stay out in front of its parent, the pupil will stay out in front of the new object.

As many missions often seemingly force Mario to collect some of the coins along the way, there are many techniques required to work around them.  The last possible star,  Mario Wings to the Sky , was collected on March 28, 2017, by Pannenkoek2012, uploaded on his second channel [1] , and an improvement was found on April 2. Ruleset No coins can be collected. Specifically, no yellow, red, or blue coins can be collected. The exploit of leaving a saveable record of 0 coins by collecting multiples of 256 is not allowed. Pause buffering to prevent the coin display from going up is not allowed, because the coin count still increases behind the scenes. No special caps can be used. Mario is allowed to wear his own normal cap. Special cap effects obtained at the start of the course are allowed, such as  Tower of the Wing Cap ,  Vanish Cap under the Moat , and  Cavern of the Metal Cap . No cannons can be used. There are no workarounds for this. Number of stars that can be collected There are 77 stars that are considered possible in RTA (Real Time Attack), where TAS-only tricks are not included. In a single-star basis, one more star can be collected, namely,  Snowman's Lost His Head . This is because the mission is not selectable unless the 8 red-coin mission is completed beforehand. [2] Stars that require non-trivial workarounds include: BoB  -  Shoot to the Island in the Sky : Going to the island can be done by long jumping from the top of the mountain. BoB  -  Behind Chain Chomp's Gate : Performing a Bob-omb clip allows Mario to go behind the gate without releasing the Chain Chomp, where a red coin would be inadvertently collected. WF  -  Shoot into the Wild Blue :  A sideflip and wall jump can easily collect the star from below. WF  -  Blast Away the Wall : A precise ledge grab at the brick wall makes Mario clip into the wall slightly, allowing Mario to collect the star. This trick is known as \" Cannonless \" and is commonly used in RTA speedruns.  However, it should be noted that the setup to make the trick easier cannot be used, since Mario would inadvertently collect the coins on the bridge. JRB  -  Blast to the Stone Pillar : The platform where the star is can be reached by precisely long jumping off the ship. JRB  and  DDD  -  Through the Jet Stream : Mario can overcome the jet stream(s) by swimming efficiently, negating the need for the metal cap. HMC  -  Metal-Head Mario Can Move! : Mario can press the purple\u00a0! switch by falling onto it with enough vertical speed downwards instead of using the metal cap to walk underwater. SSL  -  Pyramid Puzzle : Mario can collect the secrets without touching their coins by only touching the very top of the secret's hitbox. WDW  -  Quick Race Through Downtown! : The RTA viable method is to clone the star while holding a Chuckya. In a TAS run, Mario can perform a BLJ to build enough speed to clip into the cage. DDD  -  Collect the Caps... : Mario is able to simply clone the star through the loading zone by bringing a  water shell  out of the water. This cloning process is similar to the one used in Quick Race through Downtown. (Note: Unconfirmed RTA possible) CCM  -  Slip Slidin' Away  and  Big Penguin Race : Mario can use the baby penguin to clip through the mountain to reach the cabin from the side, avoiding the coins near the entrance. An alternative, RTA viable method is to have Mario dive between a rock and floor to clip through the mountain. [3] RR  -  Somewhere Over the Rainbow : Mario can use the  Pedro spot  underneath the Tricky Triangles! platform to jump to the star platform without using the cannon. [4] In a TAS run, 4 more stars are possible to collect in a full run, leading to 81 stars possible (82 stars in a single-star basis). The stars that require TAS-only workarounds include: BoB  -  Mario Wings to the Sky :  PU movement  can be used to reach the first 4 secrets before the coins near them become tangible. Premature cloning can then be used to render one of the coins near the 5th secret inert so Mario can enter the secret's hitbox without entering the hitbox of a coin. BBH  -  Eye to Eye in the Secret Room : Mario can clip into the secret room with Hyper Speed Wall Kicking until Mario reaches 400 speed, the minimum speed required to clip through a wall straight on. SL  -  Into the Igloo : Mario can perform a Low Ceiling BLJ to build speed at the entrance and navigate into the wall of the room leading to the star compartment.

The level can be beaten with or without a preset  HOLP , and is faster with that HOLP. However, both known methods of achieving this HOLP are not possible more than once without incurring additional A presses or using more time than they save. ABC Strategy The beginning of the level is the hardest part. It contains several subsequent platforms that are too high to get over without an A press and almost nothing to work with. Luckily, when the  207 DR  technique was discovered, which utilizes a  misalignment  to get extra height, all of the initial platforms except the last became passable. Then, a technique called the  Chuckya Drop  was discovered that uses manipulation to get  Chuckya  to fall from above [1] . Without Preset HOLP Leaving Chuckya behind, Mario rapidly climbs the rest of the level, using the  messed-up axle location  to cross the elevator. When he reaches the area past the arrow platform, he uses  cloning  to build a  Goomba ladder . When it is finished, Mario falls down back to the start of the level. Mario actually carries Chuckya with him for a time save later [2] , making heavy use of  Light Chuckya via Edge  to carry him quickly and with mobility. To cross gaps,  butt bounces  and  slide kicks  followed by getting thrown can be used. To cross the elevator, the messed-up axle location combined with a Chuckya throw and floor clip are used. The next gap can be crossed by throwing heavy Chuckya and being grabbed. By grinding, Chuckya can be brought onto the arrow platform. He can then throw Mario back to the checkered area. Chuckya will squeeze under the wooden obstacles as long as Mario stands on the arrow platform to lower it. With  Goomba  bounces and a perfectly-timed Chuckya throw, 13 Goomba clones are made unnecessary, leaving only 21. With Preset HOLP Setting the HOLP The necessary HOLP can be set in either  Bowser in the Fire Sea ,  Rainbow Ride , or  Bob-omb Battlefield . BitFS The necessary HOLP is just above the area with the  Bob-omb . Mario first uses the Bob-omb to set the HOLP directly under the needed HOLP. He then clones a  fire  from one of the  fire spitters , using  Pause Buffered Hitstun  (PBH) from an  explosion  clone to release it without updating the HOLP, and it releases at Mario's current height, which is at the intended HOLP. Mario then glides through the air using a  bloated Bob-omb , which he immediately releases upon touching the fire clone. He then proceeds to defeat  Bowser  by using PBH to throw him, which still causes him to appear in front of Bowser due to a quirk in Bowser's code. Then, no stars upstairs may modify the HOLP. This makes this method of setting the HOLP viable only for the any% run [3] . RR First, a Bob-omb must be brought up to the top of the big house. This is more difficult than it sounds due to complicated  handsfree teleport  techniques and branches off the strat for  the big house 0x . Mario then  frame walks  up a spire, slides down, and throws the Bob-omb in midair at the required HOLP location. He lands near the red coin star area, so he can collect the  100 coin star  (because he collected all of the big house coins) and then the  red coin star [4] . BoB This is done with a  Goomba staircase . [5] In BitS Mario crosses the elevator using the messed-up axle location as normal. When he passes the arrow platform, he uses  Pause Buffered Hitstun  from taking huge  fall damage  to throw a fire clone at the HOLP, which is on top of a pole. There are two possible poles that can be used for this. The larger of the two requires bouncing on a nearby Goomba. Once done, simple Goomba bounces and messed-up axle location uses allow Mario to reach the pipe, which he enters using a  207 DR . Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , the Grand Star can be collected. It can also be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , both the regular star and Grand Star can be collected. Neither the Grand Star nor the regular star can be collected in the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge  or  No Joystick Allowed Challenge . In the  Pacifist Challenge , both the regular star and Grand Star can be collected, as  Bowser  is an exception to the pacifist rule. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 3 B presses, to grab Bowser 3 times. B does not need to be pressed to release Bowser, since Mario can just drop him into a mine for the first two hits and get burned while swinging him around to throw him at high speed for the third hit. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge , the Grand Star can be collected. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: killing the  Mystery Goomba  and collecting its coin, reaching a  Parallel Universe  in both areas of the level, and defeating Bowser without swinging him. Mystery Goomba Main article:  Mystery Goomba All Goombas in the game fall into one of two categories:  singleton  or  triangle . Triangle Goombas have an object called a  Goomba Spawner  which loads and unloads them as Mario gets close. However, in Bowser in the Sky, there is a set of only two Goombas, which is actually a set of three triangle Goombas of which one instantly unloads. This one is called the Mystery Goomba, and there is no known way to kill him.

The star can be collected by talking to  Koopa the Quick  to start his race, and getting to the flag on the mountain before he does. The race prohibits Mario from using the cannon, which Koopa the Quick claims is \"cheating\". However, the use of teleports and the wing cap is allowed. Also, there are no protections against finishing with a time that would be normally impossible without glitches, so all forms of hyperspeed are allowed. Given that this star has a timer built in, minimizing the in-game time has been a long standing challenge since the early days of Mario 64. Using a glitch, it is possible to finish the race with an in-game time of 0.0 seconds [6] , but the star is not obtainable, because KtQ deactivates when Mario reaches the flagpole and doesn't get reactivated.

It can be accessed from the painting in the room located on the right side of the lower first floor of Princess Peach's castle. This course is typically fast and is often the first course completed in runs (due to BoB's near requirement for wing cap).

[1]  Entering this level can also be done without the use of the A button, [2]  and most likely 2 presses for the  ABZ / Buttonless Challenge . Entering this level the first time also triggers textboxes, which costs the ABZ/Buttonless Challenge at least 4 presses. (This is yet to be shown on video.) Course Versions This course has three versions- Version 1 : Accessed by selecting Star 1. This version contains King Whomp at the top of the course. Version 2 : Accessed by selecting Star 2. This version contains a fortress built on top of the course. Version 3 : Accessed by selecting Star 3 through Star 6. Bob-omb buddy is present to open the cannon, and an owl can be summoned from the tree near the starting point. The fortress is still present. Coins Whomp's Fortress has a total of 141 coins collectible without the utilization of glitches, with most coins coming from coin spawners. This course has two different coin duplication glitches, however, that push the maximum beyond 141 coins-  cloning  and the  breaking-disappearing cork box glitch . Both of these utilize the cork boxes in the level, and can both take the maximum over the max in-game coin score of 255. The breaking-disappearing cork box glitch pushes the bounds a bit farther, though, and allows 999 to be collected in course.

Entering Whomp's Fortress  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/mlHzqJn2SMs?t=33s   This part is easily done without pressing  A  by using a dive recover into the painting. Chip Off Whomp's Block  (0x) New strategy Video:  https://youtu.be/ZIje_PpDeIc This strategy uses precise movement to dive recover into a misalignment on King Whomp right after he falls. Because King Whomp still has a yaw velocity for a few frames after he falls, Mario can get displaced off the misalignment, activating vertical speed, allowing him to ground-pound King Whomp without the help of the elevator. King Whomp can be manipulated so that when he falls for the third time, the misalignment is close to where the star spawns. Therefore, after Mario ground-pounds King Whomp for the third time, he is high enough to collect the star immediately, without cloning. Original strategy Video:  https://youtu.be/7ZwwAemsbYQ   The trickiest part is collecting the star, since it hovers at 296 units above the ground [4] , too high to be reached by dive recovering. While it might seem impossible to reach the star unless an A press is used to jump, Mario can fortunately collect it by cloning. By bringing a fake cork box up and defeating King Whomp, Pannenkoek is able to clone the star and collect it by holding Vacant Slot 41 (VS41). To the Top of the Fortress  (0x) Main article:  To the Top of the Fortress New strategy Video:  https://youtu.be/nHx7r6T9ROA Before entering the stage, the  HOLP  needs to be set at a specific location in  Cool, Cool Mountain . This is done using a penguin. Upon entering the stage, Mario first collects 99 coins. He then dives from a floating island to the bottom of the course, barely taking large  fall damage . This allows him to use  pause-buffered hitstun  to remotely throw a cork box onto the big platform at the top of the course, the cork box then breaks on the bullet bill blaster. Mario climbs to the top using the elevator, spawns a 100 coin star from a cork box's coin and uses it to  Star Dance Clip  onto the bullet bill blaster. Mario  dive grinds  to build up speed and recovers into a misalignment on a tower platform. From here, he climbs up the tower and collects the star. Original strategy Video:  https://youtu.be/M4M_OyUorRQ   The Wing Cap and the Metal Cap need to be unlocked in order to use the  Hat in Hand  glitch in  BoB  and WF. Before entering the stage, the  HOLP  needs to be set at a specific location in  Bob-omb Battlefield . Upon entering the stage, Mario starts collecting many coins in order to spawn the 100-coin star at the right moment. The Metal Cap is collected twice to activate the hat-in-hand object displacement glitch. Using the glitch, Mario carries the cork box up the mountain (during which he throws the cork box multiple times and catch it while it is falling down from the HOLP to speed up the process). Using clever tricks, he is then able to pick up the cork box during the time he is ascending from the elevator, and he collects all the coins from the floating island. At this point, Mario has 99 coins. The box is then thrown to appear from the HOLP and break next to the tower, exposing the 100th coin at the desired location. Mario collects it, spawning the star next to one of the tower's steps. Mario dives down to the lower part of the course, grabbing the second cork box, and bringing it upwards. At the top floor, with precise movements, Mario remotely throws the cork box, stores 26 vertical speed on the elevator by canceling a dive recover on the steep part of it, allowing the cork box to push him off to reactivate the stored speed, ground pounding to gain height next to a platform of the tower (where the 100-coin star is), and then grabbing on the ledge while collecting the 100-coin star using  Star Dance Clip . After the collecting the star, Mario then climbs up the rest of the tower and collects  To the Top of the Fortress . For both times going up, Mario has to hold a cork box frame-walking up a slope. With very precise movements, Mario can carry the box and bounce on the ground to reach the elevator [5]  instead of having to drop the box at the HOLP and pick it up later on the arrow platform. Shoot into the Wild Blue  (0x) Video 1 (original strat):  https://youtu.be/CA-EZx_kunY   Video 2 (faster strat):  https://youtu.be/-Usau9dZJO4 The star can be collected by going from the top. Using the secret teleporter at the corner of the platform where the Metal Cap is located, Mario can teleport to a higher floor above where the star is located. Mario then drops down to collect the star. The faster strat uses an  Eru Drop  instead of a double turnaround to collect the star. Red Coins on the Floating Isle  (0x) Video 1 (original strat):  https://youtu.be/E6J71oX8o78   Video 2 (faster strat):  https://youtu.be/sqiZTyGX2ds All coins are reachable without pressing A. Fall onto the Caged Island  (0x) Video 1 (original strat):  https://youtu.be/mXy8Wlw3sRU   Video 2 (faster strat):  https://youtu.be/psNg9MFr5eo This star is done without pressing A by using  Version 1  of the course where King Whomp is present (Chip Off Whomp's Block). By manipulating the location and angle of King Whomp, Mario can land on top of Whomp and perform a dive recover onto the caged platform. Blast Away the Wall  (0x) Video 1 (original strat):  https://youtu.be/wdD21gnJ_rI   Video 2 (faster strat):  https://youtu.be/F-Vcl_CEd-w With a ledge-grab glitch very well-known in  RTA speedrunning , it is already known that using the cannon to shoot open the wall is completely unnecessary. All Mario has to do is grabbing the ledge where the star is located using a specific angle. WF 100 Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/anKoV6eZBi8   In a full game run of 120 stars, this star will already be collected while doing  To the Top of the Fortress . That being said, the star can still be collected without pressing A when done in isolation, with no difficult tricks required. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge , with  Blast Away the Wall  completed less conventionally by using a precise ledge grab in order to avoid the use of cannon. In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In a  No Buttons Allowed  challenge,  Shoot into the Wild Blue  and  Blast Away the Wall  can be collected. [6] In a  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. [7] In the  Pacifist Challenge , every star except for  Chip off Whomp's Block  can be collected in isolation. However,  To the Top of the Fortress  can not be collected in a full-game run since it is impossible to select. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 3 Z presses, all used to ground pound the Whomp King. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Shoot into the Wild Blue ,  Fall onto the Caged Island , and  Blast Away the Wall  can be collected in isolation. However, Whomp's Fortress cannot be entered at all in a full-game run because it requires talking to Lakitu.

[6] 100 Coins Mario collects coins from  Chuckya ,  coin lines ,  coin rings , the Crazy Box, Goombas, and the slide. [7]  This is enough to get 100 coins. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  Scary 'Shrooms, Red Coins ,  Mysterious Mountainside ,  Breathtaking View from Bridge , and  Blast to the Lonely Mushroom  can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses.  Mystery of the Monkey Cage  requires using hyperspeed to get  Ukiki  off of the mountain, then grabbing it with the vertical wind.  Blast to the Lonely Mushroom  requires long jumping to the mushroom on the JP 1.0 version to avoid opening the cannon. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Scale the Mountain ,  Mysterious Mountainside ,  Breathtaking View from Bridge , and  Blast to the Lonely Mushroom  can be collected.

{"prompt": "Explain BLJ", "completion": "The  Backwards  Long Jump  hyperspeed method, or  BLJ  for short, is the most famous  hyperspeed  method in Super Mario 64. Due to their versatility, BLJs are commonly used in all kinds of  speedruns  and  challenges . When Mario initiates a long jump, his horizontal speed is multiplied by 3/2. A BLJ occurs when a backwards long jump is interrupted before the effects of drag can counteract the speed gain from the 3/2 multiplier. This does not occur with forwards long jumps because long jumps have a \"hard cap\" of +48 horizontal speed which Mario's speed cannot exceed. No such cap exists in the negative direction because normally the \"soft cap\" of -16 speed from drag is easily enough to stop any speed gain. There are several different types of BLJs. The distinguishing feature of different types of BLJs is what they use to interrupt the long jump: Slope BLJs use slopes by going up the slope. Stair BLJs use stairs by going up the stairs. Elevator BLJs use the upwards movement of an elevator or other object. Side BLJs  use two floors at slightly different levels by oscillating between them. Ceiling BLJs use an exposed ceiling or low-hanging ceiling by making Mario hit his head and start travelling downwards faster. BLJs can also be  pause buffered  to increase the amount of long jumps that can be performed in a given amount of time or space. The BLJ glitch was patched in the  Shindou release , and therefore also the  iQue version . This also means that any emulator releases of these game versions lack the BLJ glitch, namely the  Japanese Wii VC release , the  Japanese Wii U VC release , and all versions of  Super Mario 3D All-Stars . Contents 1   Slope BLJ 2   Stair BLJ 3   Elevator BLJ 4   Side BLJ 5   Ceiling BLJ Slope BLJ A slope BLJ is performed by interrupting a backwards long jump using a rising slope. Because Mario usually lands immediately after long jumping (assuming a steep enough slope), slope BLJs are normally pause bufferable. Stair BLJ A stair BLJ is similar to a slope BLJ, except using stairs instead of slopes to achieve the rising floor effect. Stair BLJs often cannot be performed when there are wall hitboxes sticking out from the stairs because the walls prevent Mario from landing on the higher floor. Similarly to slope BLJs, stair BLJs are often pause bufferable. Stair BLJs are often used for bypassing doors in the castle. Elevator BLJ Elevator BLJs are also conceptually similar to slope BLJs and stair BLJs in that they too use the floor under Mario rising to interrupt Mario's long jump. Elevator BLJs use elevators as the rising floor. Elevator BLJs are a common solution for when one wishes to quickly get a lot of speed since while slope BLJs and stair BLJs can only last until the slope or stair runs out or Mario hits out-of-bounds, elevator BLJs can last as long as the elevator is moving and don't need to stop when Mario hits out-of-bounds. Because of this, elevator BLJs are the only type of BLJ that can reach  PU  speed. Side BLJ Side BLJs or SBLJs are the most complex type of BLJ. A side BLJ is performed by oscillating between two floors at slightly different heights to achieve an effect similar to a stair BLJ but without needing a long, wall-less staircase. Side BLJs are performed by first having Mario face slightly to the higher floor (so that when Mario's moving backwards, he moves down to the lower floor), then straining to the higher floor during the long jump so that Mario snaps up to it. After long jumping from the lower floor, Mario ends up on the higher floor due to the straining, but because of the direction Mario is facing he snaps down to the lower floor on the next frame. This can then be repeated. Because side BLJs require 1 extra frame per long jump for Mario to snap back down to the lower floor, they cannot be pause buffered. Ceiling BLJ A ceiling BLJ is performed by having Mario hit a ceiling during his long jumps so that Mario starts moving downwards earlier, meaning there's less time for drag to slow Mario down. Ceiling BLJs can be performed with low ceilings or with  exposed ceilings .  Lobby Backwards Long Jump  is an example of this type of BLJ. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp"}
{"prompt": "Explain Objects - Object limit", "completion": "This article is in need of changes to meet Ukikipedia quality standards. This page is most likely lacking information or may contain inaccuracies.  You can help fix it . The  discussion page  may contain suggestions. An  object  is an entity in the game that is not part of the level geometry of the course. Most objects either interact with Mario and/or move in some way, act as stationary platforms or simply exist for aesthetic purposes. The maximum number of objects in a  course  is 240. Contents 1   Object Groups 2   Processing Order 3   Object limit 4   Trivia 5   See also 6   References Object Groups Every object is part of a larger \"group\" that helps define its behavior [1] . Of the 12 groups, some are more strongly defined than others, but they are still a useful tool to categorize objects in the game. Group Name Description Player Group The first group, this group is composed of \"playable\" characters, which is simply Mario. Had Luigi been finished, it's possible he would have been in this group. Group 2 This group is unused, it is possible this would have been a Luigi group, too. Destructive The destructive group consists of (non-playable) objects able to destroy other objects. This group consists specifically of four objects- Bob-omb, Bob-omb explosion, cork shell, and a beta object that was unused. Group 4 Like the second group, this one is also unused. General Actor This group contains most normal 'enemies' or actors ( MIPS ,  Bullet Bill ,  Bully , etc) Pushable This group consists of objects able to push other (non-playable) objects. This behavior often goes along with  transport cloning . This group consists of objects such as goomba, koopa, and spiny. Level This group consists of objects within levels that are interactable, such as hearts and stars. This group often acts as \"catch-all\" along with default. Group 7 Group 7 is another unused group. Default If an object isn't put into a different group, it ends up here. For this reason, this group acts as a \"catch-all\" for odd objects. Surface These are any items that have surface collision, specifically walls, floor, and ceilings. Often these are items that would be easy to consider just part of the course geometry, such as the submarine in DDD or ship in JRB. Worth noting- this group is a requirement to have surfaces, so objects like Whomp and Thwomp still fall into this category despite being \"actors\". Polelike The polelike group consists of objects that could be described as \"radial\" in that the attract Mario to some sort of radial center. This includes poles, whirlpools, tornados, trees, etc. Spawner This group consists of most objects that spawn other objects, like coin spawners or star spawners. Unimportant Unimportant objects generally do not affect gameplay at all and exist purely for visuals. This group has the unique quality of unloading to stay under the object limit, hence their \"unimportant\" name. Some examples include smoke, wind, and dust. Processing Order During a frame, object lists are processed in the following order: Spawner, Surface, Polelike, Player, Pushable, General, Destructive, Level, Default, Unimportant  [2] Object limit The  object limit  is the maximum number of important objects a course can have loaded simultaneously before the game cannot handle loading any more. This limit is 240 at all times, but the  debug  code that displays object count fails to count certain spawners which? , making this limit seem lower in some courses citation needed . This doesn't apply to the total objects in the course, only to ones that are loaded at the time. Unloaded objects use no slots. As the object limit is approached, unimportant objects will sacrifice their slots in order to empty them for important objects.

{"prompt": "Explain Virtual Console", "completion": "The Virtual Console is the second official re-release of Super Mario 64. It is the overall fastest platform for speedrunning Super Mario 64, due to its lack of lag and fast loading times.  It is not allowed on the single star leaderboards.  Contents 1   Consoles 2   Setup (Wii) 2.1   Software 2.2   Hardware 3   Game Versions (Wii) 3.1   NTSC-U 3.2   NTSC-J Shindou Edition Consoles Super Mario 64 is available on the Virtual Console service on the  Wii  and the  Wii U .  The Wii Virtual Console is generally preferred over the Wii U because of the Wii U's inherent 4\u20135 frames of input lag caused by syncing the game to the Wii U Gamepad. GameCube controller support on the Wii is also a major advantage because despite the Wii U having an official GameCube controller adapter, it is not compatible with the Virtual Console service. Setup (Wii) Software \u2192 Setup Guide Hardware You will need a Wii that has GameCube ports. A GameCube controller is required for a basic setup, but by default, the analog stick mapping on Wii Virtual Console is inaccurate to the original (N64) in a way that makes tilting (for e.g.  speed kicks  and quick turns) harder. This is rectified by using an  ESS adapter , which remaps this to be more accurate to the original. The generally recommended one is manufactured by  Electro Modder . An ESS adapter not only allows (1) stick mapping correction, but also (2) the use of an N64 controller (as well as GameCube controller), and (3) input display. Game Versions (Wii) There are 2 versions of Super Mario 64 that were released on Wii Virtual Console. NTSC-U This is the North American release. NTSC-J Shindou Edition This is the updated Japanese release that includes support for the Rumble Pak. This version has removed the ability to perform BLJs, so 0 star, 1 star and 16 star cannot be completed. It has longer loading times than NTSC-U and NTSC-J, and slightly less lag in some sections. It is best to be avoided. The only version that Virtual Console speedrunners should be using is NTSC-U. It is faster for every category. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e RTA Guide Platforms Nintendo 64  \u2022  Virtual Console  \u2022  Emulator Categories 0/1 Star  \u2022  16 Star  \u2022  70 Star  \u2022  120 Star  \u2022  31 Star  \u2022  50 Star  \u2022  All\u00a0!

{"prompt": "Explain Key", "completion": "Bowser key Hitbox Info Hitbox cylinder with radius of 80 and height of 50, offset down 0 units Tangibility radius 1000 Interaction type Star/Key Surfaces none Related Power Star Found In Bowser Stage Bowser Keys  or  Keys  are items used to progress through  key doors  that are obtained by defeating  Bowser  at the end of a  Bowser Stage . There are two keys in  Super Mario 64 , one from  Bowser in the Dark World , which unlocks the  basement , and one from  Bowser in the Fire Sea , which unlocks the  second floor . The only way to skip a key is to do  Moat Door Skip  to go into the basement without ever having to interact with the basement key door. There is no way to skip the upstairs key door since it triggers the loading zone to the second floor, with no different entrances to get in (e.g., moat door). Because of this, Bowser in the Fire Sea is mandatory to finish the game. Behavior When the key spawns, its Y-velocity is set to 70. Sparkles are spawned and the key is set to interact with walls and floors. When the key hits the ground, it plays a sound. When the key hits the ground and has stopped bouncing, the key\u2019s action is incremented by 1. Once this occurs, the key is able to be picked up by Mario. When the key rotates, its facing angle is increased by its angular velocity each frame. If this angular velocity exceeds 5.625 degrees/frame, it is decreased by a value of 1.40625 degrees/frame every frame. Thus, the key rotates quickly when it first spawns and its rotation slows down. Glitches On the Japanese version after collecting a key, a  Star will float around Mario instead of the actual key On the Japanese version if you C-up and look somewhere else before collecting the key,  Mario's head will stay in that direction , giving the appearance of a broken neck.

He is chained to a  wooden post , and he lunges at  Mario  when he is nearby. If Mario  ground pounds  on the post 3 times to put it into the ground, Chain Chomp gets freed. A cutscene plays where Chain Chomps jumps 4 times, smashes the gate covering  the star , and jumps off into the distance.

The sound used in international versions of the game is changed to be more aggressive. Glitches Chain Chomp Falls Down The exact cause is not known, but sometimes during Chain Chomp's cutscene he will fall off past the fence, which causes his cutscene to glitch. Huge Chain Chomp Jump   Chain Chomp flying into the air after touching a bob-omb during his cutscene. When Chain Chomp touches a  Bob-omb  or a  Cork Box , he will fly into the air. Usually his chain keeps him from going very high, but if he touches a cork box or bob-omb during his cutscene, there is nothing to stop him and he flies very high into the air before landing again. After landing, he resumes his cutscene as normal. Interruption Softlock If Chain Chomp touches a thrown cork box during his cutscene, after he flies into the air and lands again, he will not resume his cutscene, resulting in a softlock. Pivot Clone The pivot point where Chain Chomp is chained to is an invisible object that loads and unloads when  Mario  goes close to it and away from it. This means it can be  cloned . Releasing a clone of chain chomp's pivot will cause him to move to there. When Mario goes away from Chain Chomp's new location, Chain Chomp will disappear. Chain Chomp will reappear when Mario goes back to the new spot, but he will appear at his normal location. From then on he behaves normally. If Mario ground pounds the post while Chain Chomp is visible at his new location, the chain chomp will start his animation at his new location. If Mario moves chain chomp away from his post with a pivot clone, makes him disappear, and ground pounds the post while Chain Chomp is invisible, then the cutscene does not activate until Chain Chomp is reloaded by going to his new location and Mario touches the ground. Chain Chomp's pivot is invisible, and since it is not rendered it does not update the  HOLP . In order to release it at a specific location, it is usually required to use a preset HOLP and a glitch such as Hat in Hand to prevent the HOLP from updating during the cloning process. Out of Bounds Softlock Chain Chomp has no collision with walls, so by moving him near a wall with a pivot clone he can easily become out of bounds. If his cutscene is activated by grounding his post, he will fall underneath the course until he reaches the default water at Y -11,000. Then he will stay at the surface of the water and not move. Since he never finishes his cutscene, this results in a softlock. Conflicting Cutscene Glitches Chain Chomp's cutscene can conflict with other cutscenes, resulting in unintended results. Big Bob-Omb Defeat Cutscene If Chain Chomp is moved to a new location with a pivot clone, deactivated, and has his post pounded, then his cutscene can be activated at any time by going near his new location. If the player defeats  King Bob-omb , but then jumps down to the Chain Chomp to activate his cutscene at the same time, the Big Bob-Omb's textbox plays first, and his star appears before the Chain Chomp does anything. After this, Mario can move around even though Chain Chomp is freed. Chain Chomp doesn't actually start his jumping cutscene unless Mario stands still for a few seconds, but Mario can still move around once it starts. Chain Chomp still has an active hurtbox during his cutscene. Chain Chomp does not disappear after his cutscene is finished if this glitch is performed. The camera remains fixed on Chain Chomp, even though Mario can still move around. This makes it difficult to see what is going on in-game, since the camera doesn't follow Mario around.

The star is too high to be collected with a dive recover but Mario can just maintain height from flying. Mario grabs the star before landing (which would've triggered the switch textbox).

{"prompt": "Explain Address Error Exception", "completion": "The  Nintendo 64 's CPU, the VR4300, can throw an  Address Error Exception . This occurs when lookup to an invalid or non-existent address occurs, most commonly as a  Null Pointer Exception , which is an Address Error Exception caused by attempting to access an address of 0 (NULL). Exploits Address Error Exceptions often have exploit potential on  Wii VC  since the Wii VC emulator ignores null pointer exceptions. This means that a read from a null address into a register will actually leave the register untouched with its last value and resume normal execution. We can then analyze  crashes  that cause Address Error Exceptions.  Cause ACE Exploitable Any Exploitable Notes Deleting a non-existent file on the File Select Screen No Doubtful sMainMenuButtons[MENU_BUTTON_ERASE]->oMenuButtonActionPhase is NULL when written to. For selecting 'NO' this results in the button zoom being unaffected. 'YES' is more complex. It's just a write and the copy menu doesn't allow for this glitch, so this is unlikely to be exploitable. Plus, there's barely anything to work with when we're not even in-game. Moving a shadow above surface 12 while it's over OOB Killing a Monty Mole remotely No No o->oMontyMoleCurrentHole->oMontyMoleHoleCooldown = 30 causes crash as mario needs to be < 1500 units for monty to select a hole (otherwise it's null) Killing an uninitialized Monty Mole No No (same as above) Going out of bounds in a room with a painting No No `gPaintingMarioFloorType` is what is affected, and it's updated every frame the OoB check happens; at most, you could  maybe  delay entering a painting by 1 frame Being pushed off of a hang-able ceiling while in the idle hanging action No Doubtful No effect for idle loop hang t8, last use of t8 set is  jr t8  which is never the hang-able value 0x05) Relevant code (sp24 is gMarioState):    //!

After that, `perform_hanging_step` will catch the fact that Mario's ceiling is NULL and stop the hang. Similar effects on PAL version. Sound glitch N/A N/A The cause of sound glitch is unknown. Contrary to popular belief, it can sometimes occur on versions other than the original Japanese N64 release. Teleporting while passing over a loading zone Unknown Yes Since the area changed, there is now no teleporter with the same ID as the one Mario used to warp. Thus the game returns NULL when trying to find the teleporter to warp to, and crashes when trying to access information about its destination. Under certain conditions, this can cause a Wrong Warp on PAL or Shindou VC. Warping out of a level while passing over a loading zone Similar to above, but only hypothetical. Maybe possible in DDD using the Sub Gate warp and whirlpool cloning to reach the instant loading zone, but not yet achieved without hacks."}

The first time  Super Mario 64  was shown was at the  Shoshinkai show in November of 1995 , with the introduction of the Nintendo 64 (Ultra 64 at the time). Early footage of the show revealed the 50% complete beta version of  Super Mario 64 , in which it looked completely different than what the final product looked like. [1]  The final product was supposed to come out in December, but it was delayed further, and the entire game was rebuilt. On May 16th, 1996 (E3 1996) the game was shown off and is almost like the final game. [2]  The entire game was almost accessible, some details got changed before the release, such as the different star icon in the HUD, a rock spike at the top of the mountain in  Bob-omb Battlefield , and other small details that were changed. The game was rushed at the end of development as told by one of the programmers of  Super Mario 64 , and a couple of the team members never wanted to make games anymore due to being burnt out after working on  Super Mario 64 . [3]  The game was released in Japan on June 23rd 1996, then on September 29th, 1996 in North America, and finally on March 1st, 1997 in Europe. Game Versions There are many different versions of the game, differing by where, when, how, and in what way they were released. N64 The Nintendo 64 console is less robust than modern consoles, so its CPU is more likely to crash when confronted by errors and other unforeseen occurrences. Japanese The very first version of the game to be commercially released, the Japanese N64 version was succeeded by the  Shindou  version a year after release. The Japanese version has a few glitches that were later fixed in all other versions, such as  spawning displacement ,  the lack of a coin limit ,  time stop  and others. It is also notable for being the fastest version of the game for the  1 Key  category (and some others). This is because the text takes longer, but the lack of narration makes the game shorter. The text in the first Bowser fight is avoided during the 1 Key run, so the Japanese version becomes faster. English See also:  Version Differences The English version and all successive versions added some extra dialogue over the Japanese version. For example, Mario does not say \"Haha\", and Peach does not narrate her \"Dear Mario\" letter. In addition, she does not talk during the ending. It fixes some errors and glitches from the previous version, such as the lack of a coin limit. It has, in general, less text than the Japanese version, but takes longer during the intro and ending due to Peach's narration. PAL The European release of  Super Mario 64  supports language changing in the settings menu between English, French, and German. This is optimal for the  ABZ Button Challenge  because the Start button can be used to change language and the language with the least text can be selected. Due to  Wii VC Round-To-Zero , however, the true optimal PAL version is not on N64. Outside of ABZ, PAL is little-used because changing languages wastes time and English is effectively identical if you do not change languages. Because of the PAL video format using 50hz instead of NTSC's 60hz, PAL runs at 25  frames  per second rather than 30, another reason why it is suboptimal for speedruns/TASes. Shindou The final release of  Super Mario 64  on the Nintendo 64 was once again released in Japanese. It enabled a compiler flag to allow optimizations, which results in less lag. It also fixed the infamous  Backwards Long Jump  glitch, which is why it is rarely used in speedruns, except in the  BLJless  category. Strangely, when grabbing a  pole  on this version, horizontal speed affects Mario's angle. The game introduced new voice clips like \"Bye, bye!\" when throwing Bowser. Some of Mario's voice clips are high-pitched in this version. This version would later be used for Super Mario 3D All-Stars. iQue (Chinese) Main article:  Super Mario 64 (iQue) The iQue version of the game runs on the iQue Player, a rare handheld N64 variant only released in China. The iQue version is in fact the Shindou version translated to Chinese, and as such it does not have BLJs or the Bob-omb or Bully angle crashes. By hacking a romhack by Kaze onto an iQue, it was found that the camera going to a  Parallel Universe  does crash the game like on the N64 console. [4] 64DD Version Super Mario 64  DD Version or SM64DD (called Super Mario Disk Version on the title screen) was an unreleased version of the game for the 64DD, likely made to test the load times of the system. The 64DD was a commercial failure, and the DD version was never released. Only one known copy of this version exists, owned by adonfjv, who found it at a Japanese video game store in 2014 [5] . The ROM (NDD) of this version has since been dumped. SM64DD is effectively the Japanese version of SM64 ported to the 64DD, with most (but not all) sounds replaced with their PAL versions. For example, the red coin and the sliding star door sounds are the same as in the Japanese release. The title screen is vastly different, resembling the hidden debug mode's level select screen. Since it is on a disk, load times are increased. The most major difference is that entering the inside of the island in  Tiny-Huge Island , where Wiggler and red coins reside, will crash the game. This makes collecting all 120 stars impossible on this version. The crash is console only, and occurs due to Wiggler's health value being uninitialized (the original Japanese and USA releases do not crash from this programming oversight as a coincidence). Wii VC Main article:  Virtual Console The Wii acts differently from the N64. It is much less likely to crash. Unlike the N64, it does not crash from  PU crashes ,   Bully angle crash , or Bob-omb angle crash. The emulation software also  rounds floats differently  from other consoles. Another difference is that it does not crash from the  Address Error Exception . It is currently unknown whether the Wii crashes upon having infinity speed. Japanese Japanese Wii VC is actually the Shindou edition, not the original Japanese version. This is why it does not have spawning displacement or other Japanese N64-exclusive glitches, nor does it have BLJs. It is almost never used for speedrunning for that reason. English English Wii VC is the optimal Wii VC for speedruns. It avoids the lack of BLJs in the Japanese version and the slower framerate of the PAL version. It is used for the  A Button Challenge  any% run because  Bowser in the Fire Sea  takes 0 A presses instead of 1 due to a rounding error. PAL PAL Wii VC is rarely seen because it is obscure and slow. However, it is actually the ideal game version for the ABZ Button Challenge, at least for any%, because it contains both language switching and the rounding error in BitFS. Wii U VC Main article:  Virtual Console The Wii U Virtual Console version has no known interesting glitches that set it apart from either N64 or Wii VC. It is identical to Wii VC, except that the rounding error is absent. Like Wii VC, it ignores  Address Error Exceptions . Wii U VC is often joked by speedrunners for have a high amount of input lag and it is mostly used only by new runners. Japanese Much like Wii VC, Japanese Wii U VC is the Shindou version. This means that BLJs and other glitches that were patched in the Shindou version are absent.  English Also like Wii VC, American Wii U VC is the US version. PAL PAL Wii U VC is actually the US version (unlike on Wii VC), so it's identical to the US Wii U VC. [6] Switch Super Mario 3D All-Stars Super Mario 3D All-Stars  includes an upscaled  Super Mario 64 . The version is the Shindou version with Lua scripts to hack in English text, new upscaled textures, and slight changes to accommodate the Switch control scheme (for example, \"PRESS +\" on the Mario head screen instead of \"PRESS START\"). [7]  The Switch does not have  the Wii's rounding error , but it does ignore  Address Error Exceptions . Nintendo Switch Online Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack includes  Super Mario 64  as part of the Nintendo 64 emulated games. Unlike  Super Mario 3D All-Stars , the Nintendo Switch Online version still has BLJs. [8] Super Mario 64 DS Main article:  Super Mario 64 DS Super Mario 64 DS  is a remake of  Super Mario 64  for the DS. Its physics are vastly different and there is no evidence that it shares any code with the original N64 release but may very likely have used the original N64 models for levels and areas; therefore it is not usually considered a \"version\" of  Super Mario 64 , but rather a rerelease. It has 150 stars instead of the original's 120, more powerups, different playable characters with different special abilities, and more.

{"prompt": "Explain Backwards Long Jump - Low Ceiling BLJ", "completion": "The  Backwards  Long Jump  hyperspeed method, or  BLJ  for short, is the most famous  hyperspeed  method in Super Mario 64. Due to their versatility, BLJs are commonly used in all kinds of  speedruns  and  challenges . When Mario initiates a long jump, his horizontal speed is multiplied by 3/2. A BLJ occurs when a backwards long jump is interrupted before the effects of drag can counteract the speed gain from the 3/2 multiplier. This does not occur with forwards long jumps because long jumps have a \"hard cap\" of +48 horizontal speed which Mario's speed cannot exceed. No such cap exists in the negative direction because normally the \"soft cap\" of -16 speed from drag is easily enough to stop any speed gain. There are several different types of BLJs. The distinguishing feature of different types of BLJs is what they use to interrupt the long jump: Slope BLJs use slopes by going up the slope. Stair BLJs use stairs by going up the stairs. Elevator BLJs use the upwards movement of an elevator or other object. Side BLJs  use two floors at slightly different levels by oscillating between them. Ceiling BLJs use an exposed ceiling or low-hanging ceiling by making Mario hit his head and start travelling downwards faster. BLJs can also be  pause buffered  to increase the amount of long jumps that can be performed in a given amount of time or space. The BLJ glitch was patched in the  Shindou release , and therefore also the  iQue version . This also means that any emulator releases of these game versions lack the BLJ glitch, namely the  Japanese Wii VC release , the  Japanese Wii U VC release , and all versions of  Super Mario 3D All-Stars . Contents 1   Slope BLJ 2   Stair BLJ 3   Elevator BLJ 4   Side BLJ 5   Ceiling BLJ Slope BLJ A slope BLJ is performed by interrupting a backwards long jump using a rising slope. Because Mario usually lands immediately after long jumping (assuming a steep enough slope), slope BLJs are normally pause bufferable. Stair BLJ A stair BLJ is similar to a slope BLJ, except using stairs instead of slopes to achieve the rising floor effect. Stair BLJs often cannot be performed when there are wall hitboxes sticking out from the stairs because the walls prevent Mario from landing on the higher floor. Similarly to slope BLJs, stair BLJs are often pause bufferable. Stair BLJs are often used for bypassing doors in the castle. Elevator BLJ Elevator BLJs are also conceptually similar to slope BLJs and stair BLJs in that they too use the floor under Mario rising to interrupt Mario's long jump. Elevator BLJs use elevators as the rising floor. Elevator BLJs are a common solution for when one wishes to quickly get a lot of speed since while slope BLJs and stair BLJs can only last until the slope or stair runs out or Mario hits out-of-bounds, elevator BLJs can last as long as the elevator is moving and don't need to stop when Mario hits out-of-bounds. Because of this, elevator BLJs are the only type of BLJ that can reach  PU  speed. Side BLJ Side BLJs or SBLJs are the most complex type of BLJ. A side BLJ is performed by oscillating between two floors at slightly different heights to achieve an effect similar to a stair BLJ but without needing a long, wall-less staircase. Side BLJs are performed by first having Mario face slightly to the higher floor (so that when Mario's moving backwards, he moves down to the lower floor), then straining to the higher floor during the long jump so that Mario snaps up to it. After long jumping from the lower floor, Mario ends up on the higher floor due to the straining, but because of the direction Mario is facing he snaps down to the lower floor on the next frame. This can then be repeated. Because side BLJs require 1 extra frame per long jump for Mario to snap back down to the lower floor, they cannot be pause buffered. Ceiling BLJ A ceiling BLJ is performed by having Mario hit a ceiling during his long jumps so that Mario starts moving downwards earlier, meaning there's less time for drag to slow Mario down. Ceiling BLJs can be performed with low ceilings or with  exposed ceilings .  Lobby Backwards Long Jump  is an example of this type of BLJ. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp"}

It is accessed through a hole in the floor behind  Dire, Dire Docks , which is behind the 30 star door in the basement. Collecting the key from this level is required to complete the game as it unlocks the door to go upstairs. Coins Location Count 2 coins on the 2 platforms floating in lava at the very beginning 2 Line of coins on the second sinking platform at beginning 5 Ring of coins (along with red coin) up a platform to left of bully 8 3 coins in an\u00a0! block after rising platform with the poll 3 Line of coins after elevator (on big grey triangle platform) 5 Ring of coins under wire grid (hang on it to get them) 8 Vertical line of coins, past 2nd\u00a0! block (fall through hole to get) 5 Sloped line of coins, just before the bob-omb 5 10 coins in an\u00a0! block with the bob-omb 10 Line of coins on third sinking platform after bob-omb 5 4 Bullies 4 3 Goombas 3 1 Bob-omb 1 8 Red Coins 16 Total 80 A Press Counts In the A Button Challenge, it takes 1 A press to beat the level (with or without the red coin star) in the 120 star category, because the N64 J version is used. However, it takes 0 A presses to beat the level (with or without the red coin star) in the any% category, because the  Wii VC  version is used instead. The A press is required to  jump off the pole , which was saved on the  Wii VC  version using the  Wii VC Rounding to Zero  glitch. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , the key can be collected. It can also be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , both the star and key can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , neither the star nor key can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , both the star and key can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , both the star and key can be collected, as  Bowser  is an exception to the pacifist rule. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 1 B press, to grab Bowser. Bowser does not need to be released with B, since Mario can just drop him into a mine. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge , the key can be collected. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: getting infinite coins, collecting the  key  on the death barrier, and reaching a  Parallel Universe  in the Bowser fight. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Courses Main Courses First Floor Bob-omb Battlefield  \u2022  Whomp's Fortress  \u2022  Jolly Roger Bay  \u2022  Cool, Cool Mountain  \u2022  Big Boo's Haunt Basement Hazy Maze Cave  \u2022  Lethal Lava Land  \u2022  Shifting Sand Land  \u2022  Dire, Dire Docks Second Floor Snowman's Land  \u2022  Wet-Dry World  \u2022  Tall, Tall Mountain  \u2022  Tiny-Huge Island Third Floor Tick Tock Clock  \u2022  Rainbow Ride Special Courses The Castle The Castle Bowser Stages Bowser in the Dark World  \u2022  Bowser in the Fire Sea  \u2022  Bowser in the Sky Secret Courses The Princess's Secret Slide  \u2022  Secret Aquarium  \u2022  Wing Mario over the Rainbow Switch Courses Tower of the Wing Cap  \u2022  Vanish Cap under the Moat  \u2022  Cavern of the Metal Cap"}

King Bob-omb will only spawn if the first star in the star select is selected. Contents 1   Tips 2   Beginner 3   Advanced 4   Expert Tips To kick up slopes, press B while holding down A. Push against the wall at the other side of the warp and return the control stick to neutral to warp quickly. Be sure to release the stick  after  pushing against the wall, otherwise Mario will bonk. To get up to the warp with four wallkicks, hold neutral during the wallkicks and make sure you're holding A as long as possible. Tapping A will result in a small wallkick with less height. Try to avoid getting a firsty on the first wallkick, as it will make timing the second wallkick more difficult. Beginner Load video YouTube YouTube might collect personal data.

{"prompt": "Explain Forward shell hyperspeed", "completion": "Forward Shell Hyperspeed  is a  hyperspeed technique  where Mario builds up speed by repeatedly jumping against an  unreferenced wall  while riding a shell. When jumping while riding a shell, Mario's speed is not reduced by 20% as for regular single jumps. In riding shell ground action, Mario's speed is capped at 64 (+ 1 frame of slope acceleration), but if Mario jumps on the frame he touches the ground, the cap doesn't take place and Mario continues to accelerate. The most speed that can be obtained with this is 282-400, depending on the wall angles and projections [note 1] . The speed is gained via air acceleration, which increases Mario's speed by 0.15 every frame. Notes \u2191   With axis aligned walls, the most distance Mario can move while still hitting both walls is when facing exactly 45\u00b0 into the referenced wall, allowing 200*sqrt(2) \u2248 282.84 speed.

{"prompt": "Explain Monty Mole", "completion": "Monty Mole Technical Constants Object Group General Actor Actor Group Group 6 Hitbox Interaction Type Bounce Top Damage 1 Health 1 Radius 70 Height 50 Down Offset 0 Monty Moles  are uncommon enemies found in  Hazy Maze Cave  and  Tall, Tall Mountain . They pop out of holes, attack Mario by throwing rocks at him, and then jump back into their holes. If Mario kills 8 Monty Moles in a row, he will get a 1-up. Contents 1   Spawning 2   Crashes 2.1   Long Range Mole Kill Crash 2.2   Uninitialized Monty Mole Crash 2.3   Pebble Crash 3   Trivia 4   References Spawning When the course is loaded, Monty Moles are found uninitialized in a location away from any Monty Mole holes. When Mario gets within 1500 units of a hole, the Monty Mole becomes initialized and snaps to the hole. The Monty Mole will then cycle through the holes available within 1500 units of Mario. Note that although HMC has 3 holes and TTM has 9 holes, each course has 1 and 2 Monty Moles, respectively. Since they teleport between each hole, this gives off the illusion that there are many Monty Moles attacking Mario.  Crashes Long Range Mole Kill Crash Even though Monty Moles are supposed to be intangible when they jump into their hole, Bob-Ombs can still interact with them during the frame. If the Bob-Omb kills the Mole while Mario is more than 1500 units away from every hole, the game will crash because the Monty Mole will try to select a new hole while none are available. This crash can occur using the Bob-Ombs on TTM. Uninitialized Monty Mole Crash If Mario attacks a Monty Mole before it has been initialized, the game will crash. This can be done in both TTM and HMC. In HMC, the uninitialized Mole can be found in the toxic maze, and taking an unusual route can lead the player to it without activating any of the holes. The mole is invisible but can damage Mario and be damaged, the latter crashing the game. The Mole in TTM is located on the death barrier vertically and at the origin laterally. This mole can be reached using a 100 coin star clone and killing it crashes the game. Pebble Crash By placing Mario in a specific spot in TTM, the game can crash from too many objects being loaded due to Monty Mole pebbles. When Mario stands in the location, two Monty Mole holes and at a position where the moles will throw pebbles over Mario and over the edge of the mountain. Since the pebbles are deactivated when 4000 units from Mario, they never reach the death barrier if Mario does not move move towards them to reactivate them again. Eventually, the deactivated pebbles take up so many object slots that the game crashes due to the object limit being reached. Trivia Killing Monty Moles in the two most separate holes in TTM one after another will reset the counter that is used to determine if Mario is given a 1-up for killing 8 moles. This happens because the two most separate holes are more than 1500 units away from each other.

Contents 1   Glitches/Exploits 1.1   Scuttlebug Raising 1.2   Scuttlebug Transportation 1.3   Despawning Glitches/Exploits Scuttlebugs have some glitches in their movement. Scuttlebug Raising Scuttlebugs can be raised by using scuttlebug raising (todo: add more info on this). Scuttlebug Transportation Since Scuttlebugs update their home whenever they bump into Mario, Mario can make a Scuttlebug walk farther from their intended area than normal by repeatedly strategically bumping into a Scuttlebug at the edge of the radius of its home. Scuttlebug Transportation is used a few times in the  A Button Challenge . It is used to save A Presses in  Hazy Maze Cave  and  Big Boo's Haunt . Scuttlebugs try to remain within a certain radius of their home, and if they move out, they try to go back in. But a Scuttlebug's home can move if Mario bumps into the Scuttlebug. So by strategically repeatedly luring the Scuttlebug to the end of its radius and bumping into it, Mario can transport the Scuttlebug as far as needed as long as the Scuttlebug can walk there. This can be used to move a Scuttlebug almost anywhere within a given room, but cannot  be used to move the Scuttlebug into another room. Despawning This is an intentional behavior made by the developers, but it can have unintended consequences. Scuttlebugs will unload if they walk into a wall too far below their home. The intended result of this is that if a scuttlebug falls into a hole where Mario would die, it will unload. The unintended result of this is that if a scuttlebug walks too far down a slope and happens to bump a wall, it will unload. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Objects Enemies Regular Amp  \u2022  Bob-omb  \u2022  Boo  \u2022  Bookend  \u2022  Bomp  \u2022  Bub   \u2022  Bubba  \u2022  Bullet Bill  \u2022  Bully  \u2022  Chain Chomp  \u2022  Chuckya  \u2022  Fly Guy  \u2022  Goomba  \u2022  Grindel  \u2022  Haunted Chair  \u2022  Heave-Ho  \u2022  Klepto  \u2022  Koopa  \u2022  Lakitu  \u2022  Mad Piano  \u2022  Moneybag  \u2022  Monty Mole  \u2022  Mr. Blizzard  \u2022  Mr. I  \u2022  Piranha Plant  \u2022  Fire Piranha Plant  \u2022  Pokey  \u2022  Scuttlebug  \u2022  Skeeter  \u2022  Snufit  \u2022  Spindel  \u2022  Spindrift  \u2022  Spiny  \u2022  Sushi  \u2022  Swoop  \u2022  Thwomp  \u2022  Tox Box  \u2022  Unagi  \u2022  Whomp Bosses King Bob-omb  \u2022   Big Boo  \u2022   Big Bully  \u2022  Bowser  \u2022  Eyerok  \u2022  Manta Ray  \u2022  Whomp King  \u2022  Wiggler NPCs Bob-omb Buddy  \u2022  Koopa the Quick  \u2022  Penguin  \u2022  Hoot  \u2022  MIPS  \u2022  Toad  \u2022  Ukiki  \u2022  Yoshi Other Objects Common Yellow Coin  \u2022  Blue Coin  \u2022  Red Coin  \u2022  1-Up Mushroom  \u2022  Bowling Ball  \u2022  Cannon  \u2022  Power Star  \u2022  Seesaw platforms  \u2022  Wing Cap  \u2022  Vanish Cap  \u2022  Metal Cap  \u2022  Elevator  \u2022  Sign  \u2022  Wooden post  \u2022  Cork Box  \u2022  Crazy Box  \u2022  Teleporter  \u2022  Warp Pipe  \u2022  Secret Level Specific Big Boo's Haunt tilting platform  \u2022  Merry-Go-Round  \u2022  Treadmill  \u2022  Pendulum  \u2022  Spinner  \u2022  Bowser Bomb  \u2022  Bowser key  \u2022  Grand Star  \u2022  Lethal Lava Land Drawbridge  \u2022  Tilted Inverted Pyramid Platform  \u2022  BitDW Trapdoor  \u2022  Controllable Platform  \u2022  Boulder Unused Boo key  \u2022  Bowser Anchor  \u2022  Fish spawner  \u2022  Trampoline  \u2022"}

For example, if one of these floating point values is 40,000, then 40,000 - 65,536 = -25,536 will be used when determining if the object is aligned with a floor or ceiling. This gives the illusion that the floors and ceilings of the main level map are \"copied\" repeatedly in a uniform 3D grid, at a spacing of 65,536 units.   Frame of Peter Fedak's video where he turns Parallel Universes visible using hacks; notice the lack of  objects The truncation responsible for the existence of parallel universes is only performed when determining alignment with floors and ceilings. This means that walls and objects, both of which use floating point arithmetic to determine collision, do not \"exist\" in PUs, unless they are brought there. Due to the extremely high speed required to travel to PUs, they are not accessible from all courses. The courses where PUs can or cannot be accessed are summarized in the tables below. Work is ongoing to try to access PUs in courses such as  Bowser in the Fire Sea  (via  Bully battery ) and demo courses (via massive  Spawning displacement ). Methods to access a PU are: Speed: EBLJ HSW HSP BB Speed Conservation Displacement: Pole Teleport Platform Displacement Note that EBLJ (and other types of BLJs), and BB (Bully battery) cannot be achieved on Shindou versions. Also, if a method requires to set  HOLP  in a PU, then it is only possible to do it on VC (because other versions crash if a camera is in the PU, and by locking camera on the main map, the HOLP wont update, because camera being too far is one of the cases where HOLP doesn't update).

However, these behave completely differently to horizontal PUs. While truncated coordinates are used to  find  the floor below the object and the ceiling above the object, the original floating point values are used to determine what  effect  these surfaces have on the object. For example, when Mario is less than 160 units below the nearest ceiling, he is considered to be \"above\" the ceiling, his vertical speed is killed, and he bonks. If Mario moves to a positive (upward) vertical PU, the \"nearest\" ceiling will be determined based on truncated coordinates, and will therefore be in the main map. But when checking whether he is above this ceiling, floating point coordinates are used instead, and so Mario behaves as though he is stuck in a ceiling. This behavior results in positive vertical PUs appearing to be filled entirely with ceilings. [2] On the other hand, when Mario is below his \"nearest\" floor, he will snap up to it. This means that if Mario moves to a negative vertical PU, he will usually upwarp back to the main PU grid. This is called an  overflow jump , or  OJ  for short. It is typically difficult to get to a vertical PU. In the positive direction, there is a ceiling at  y  = 20,000 that prevents upward movement. We can bypass this ceiling by pressing against OoB, for example by using  hyperspeed flying . We can also use  platform displacement  or  indefinite owl flight  to reach a positive vertical PU. In the negative direction, we can use a  negative jump  to jump downward with large amounts of negative speed, or platform displacement. Travel and movement   Mario looking to the original map from a PU   Mario  BLJing  to a PU Parallel universes have found uses in both speed TASes and the  A Button Challenge  since they allow greater control of movement through a level. PU routing is comparable to movement through a five-dimensional space, as Mario can be modeled as traveling along five axes: three \"relative\" axes describing his position within the map, and two integers to specify which PU he is currently in. These PU axis integers are Mario's coordinates on the PU grid. Mario can adjust his  speed  and  angle  to move relatively around the stage regardless of how many PUs he moves in the  x  or  z  dimensions. Mario's movement is split up into four  quarter steps , and if any of these quarter steps attempts to place Mario out of bounds, his movement is canceled. Therefore in order to move to a PU, Mario's speed must be a multiple of four times the distance between PUs. If Mario takes all four quarter steps, then he will move four PUs in a single frame. This distance is called the  Quadruple Parallel Universe , or  QPU , distance. If one of Mario's quarter steps (other than the first one) ends out of bounds, the game will cut his movement short. In this case, Mario does not travel the full QPU distance, and instead ends at whichever PU he made it to before his intended quarter step became out of bounds. He is then \"QPU misaligned.\" As traveling to PUs involves moving very far from the origin, floating point imprecision can begin to have a significant effect on Mario's position, angle, and collision. When Mario's position becomes large enough, this imprecision will result in the coordinates in PUs becoming so coarse that Mario cannot cross from one coordinate to the next and, eventually, will result in certain PUs being completely unaccessible. Floating point truncation crash While in theory the grid of PUs extends indefinitely, the behavior of the truncation operation becomes \"undefined\" when the floating point value is outside the range -2 31  to 2 31  - 1. The Nintendo 64 and  iQue  Player [3]  versions of the game crash when such a truncation is attempted. The Wii and Wii U virtual console versions of the game do not crash, though it is not currently known whether they wrap around the 32-bit integer range, or cap to the endpoints of the range. Most emulators do not properly emulate the crash, except for a specific version of Mupen64, modded to crash correctly. While movement to PUs at coordinates this large is rarely useful, this crash can occur due to other instances of truncation in the game, even in PUs close to the main map. For example, when determining Mario's tilt while walking, the game multiples Mario's speed by 16,384 and then truncates this value. This means that the game can crash in certain conditions when Mario has a speed of about 131,000, which is below QPU speed. While not all conditions for these types of crashes are known, there are some that come up frequently. These are when: The camera enters a PU Mario bonks while in a PU Mario's quarter step gets canceled while on the ground Mario collides with a wall head-on with PU speed Miscellaneous behavior Certain objects and graphics behave interestingly while in parallel universes.

{"prompt": "Explain Backwards Long Jump - Slope BLJ", "completion": "The  Backwards  Long Jump  hyperspeed method, or  BLJ  for short, is the most famous  hyperspeed  method in Super Mario 64. Due to their versatility, BLJs are commonly used in all kinds of  speedruns  and  challenges . When Mario initiates a long jump, his horizontal speed is multiplied by 3/2. A BLJ occurs when a backwards long jump is interrupted before the effects of drag can counteract the speed gain from the 3/2 multiplier. This does not occur with forwards long jumps because long jumps have a \"hard cap\" of +48 horizontal speed which Mario's speed cannot exceed. No such cap exists in the negative direction because normally the \"soft cap\" of -16 speed from drag is easily enough to stop any speed gain. There are several different types of BLJs. The distinguishing feature of different types of BLJs is what they use to interrupt the long jump: Slope BLJs use slopes by going up the slope. Stair BLJs use stairs by going up the stairs. Elevator BLJs use the upwards movement of an elevator or other object. Side BLJs  use two floors at slightly different levels by oscillating between them. Ceiling BLJs use an exposed ceiling or low-hanging ceiling by making Mario hit his head and start travelling downwards faster. BLJs can also be  pause buffered  to increase the amount of long jumps that can be performed in a given amount of time or space. The BLJ glitch was patched in the  Shindou release , and therefore also the  iQue version . This also means that any emulator releases of these game versions lack the BLJ glitch, namely the  Japanese Wii VC release , the  Japanese Wii U VC release , and all versions of  Super Mario 3D All-Stars . Contents 1   Slope BLJ 2   Stair BLJ 3   Elevator BLJ 4   Side BLJ 5   Ceiling BLJ Slope BLJ A slope BLJ is performed by interrupting a backwards long jump using a rising slope. Because Mario usually lands immediately after long jumping (assuming a steep enough slope), slope BLJs are normally pause bufferable. Stair BLJ A stair BLJ is similar to a slope BLJ, except using stairs instead of slopes to achieve the rising floor effect. Stair BLJs often cannot be performed when there are wall hitboxes sticking out from the stairs because the walls prevent Mario from landing on the higher floor. Similarly to slope BLJs, stair BLJs are often pause bufferable. Stair BLJs are often used for bypassing doors in the castle. Elevator BLJ Elevator BLJs are also conceptually similar to slope BLJs and stair BLJs in that they too use the floor under Mario rising to interrupt Mario's long jump. Elevator BLJs use elevators as the rising floor. Elevator BLJs are a common solution for when one wishes to quickly get a lot of speed since while slope BLJs and stair BLJs can only last until the slope or stair runs out or Mario hits out-of-bounds, elevator BLJs can last as long as the elevator is moving and don't need to stop when Mario hits out-of-bounds. Because of this, elevator BLJs are the only type of BLJ that can reach  PU  speed. Side BLJ Side BLJs or SBLJs are the most complex type of BLJ. A side BLJ is performed by oscillating between two floors at slightly different heights to achieve an effect similar to a stair BLJ but without needing a long, wall-less staircase. Side BLJs are performed by first having Mario face slightly to the higher floor (so that when Mario's moving backwards, he moves down to the lower floor), then straining to the higher floor during the long jump so that Mario snaps up to it. After long jumping from the lower floor, Mario ends up on the higher floor due to the straining, but because of the direction Mario is facing he snaps down to the lower floor on the next frame. This can then be repeated. Because side BLJs require 1 extra frame per long jump for Mario to snap back down to the lower floor, they cannot be pause buffered. Ceiling BLJ A ceiling BLJ is performed by having Mario hit a ceiling during his long jumps so that Mario starts moving downwards earlier, meaning there's less time for drag to slow Mario down. Ceiling BLJs can be performed with low ceilings or with  exposed ceilings .  Lobby Backwards Long Jump  is an example of this type of BLJ. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp"}
{"prompt": "Explain Blink", "completion": "You may be looking for  Hitstun blinking , the cause of  Pause buffered hitstun . Blinking  is the phenomenon in which many  objects  appear to blink their eyes. The only creatures that blink are  Mario ,  Peach ,  Bowser ,  Eyerok ,  Pokeys ,  Koopas  of all kinds (including  Koopa the Quick ),  Goombas ,  Lakitu ,  Penguins  of all kinds,  Bob-ombs ,  Pink Bob-ombs ,  Mr. I , and  Yoshi . Of these, Mr. I and Eyerok blink based on Mario's interactions with them. All other creatures blink idly. Contents 1   Blinking Systems 1.1   Mario/Peach 1.2   Bowser 1.3   Penguins 1.4   Common Enemy 1.5   RNG 2   References Blinking Systems There are several different blinking systems the game uses to determine when an object should blink. Mario/Peach The Mario/Peach blinking system uses the game's animation timer to determine when Mario and Peach should blink. Mario and Peach each have a blinking animation that lasts 14 frames, and the game performs bitwise calculations each frame to determine whether or not to play the animation. These calculations make it so that Mario will blink every 64 frames, and Peach will blink every 64 frames. However, Peach's blinking animation is offset from Mario's by 32, meaning that they will never blink at the same time. Bowser If the difference between Bowser's moving angle and his angle to Mario is greater than 45 degrees, Bowser looks to the side and does not blink unless his blinking animation has already started. If Bowser is not looking to the side, he will do his blinking animation every 64 frames. The blinking animation takes 16 frames to complete, 4 of which have Bowser's eyes partially closed, 4 of which have Bowser's eyes completely closed, and 8 of which have Bowser's eyes open. Because Bowser's blinking counter increments when the game is paused, Bowser will blink when the game is paused if he is not looking to the side. Penguins The Penguins (small and large) use the global timer to control their blinking. The Penguin's blinking timer is taken from the global timer modulo 50. When the timer is greater than 43, the Penguin starts to blink. The Penguin's eyes are partially closed for 2 frames, then closed for 2 frames, then partially closed for 3 frames, and then open again. Thus, the Penguins blink every 50 frames and the animation lasts 7 frames. Since the global timer increments while the game is paused, Penguins will blink even when the game is paused. Common Enemy This system is used by Goombas, Pokeys, Lakitus, Koopas, and Koopa the Quick. This system uses a countdown timer with a randomly generated number. When the countdown timer is below a certain value, the object blinks, and then calls RNG to determine a new number to begin the countdown from. Goombas blink when the countdown is from 5 to 0, and the countdown is reset to a number between 30 and 79. Pokeys blink when the countdown is from 4 to 0, and the countdown is reset to a number between 30 and 89. Lakitus blink when the countdown is from 4 to 0, and the countdown is reset to a number between 20 and 59. Koopas blink when the countdown is from 4 to 0, and the countdown is reset to a number between 20 and 69. Koopa the Quick blinks when the countdown is from 3 to 0, and the countdown is reset to a number between 10 and 24. RNG This system is used by Bob-ombs and Yoshi. Bob-ombs call  RNG  every frame to determine if they should blink. Specifically, it calls for a random float between 0 and 1, which is then multiplied by 100 and cast to an integer. If the integer it is cast to is 0 (the random float is less than 1/100), the Bob-omb begins its blinking animation. The animation lasts 15 frames, after which the game calls for RNG again. Thus, Bob-ombs and Yoshi will blink about once every 100 frames on average. However, since this is completely based on RNG, in practice this can be made much shorter or longer with RNG manipulation.

{"prompt": "Explain Long Jump", "completion": "Long Jump Properties Official Name broadJump (Broad Jump) Hex 0x03000888 Action Flags Air, Allow Vertical Wind Action, Control Jump Height Action Group Airborne ID 0x088 Other Animation 0x13, 0x14 The  long jump  action is a jump that is mainly based horizontally and can be used to cross large gaps. This is generally done by crouching and then pressing A. In certain situations,  backward long jumps  may be tied together to gain large amounts of speed due to their unbounded nature. Behavior Certain things here are more explained on their individual pages. If something lacks detail, check the link for more information. As with all airborne actions, a variety of \"cancels\" are checked prior to actually performing the long jump action. These checks are as follows: Water - If Mario's height is lower than 100 units below the water height, the action is transitioned into the  water plunge  action. Squish - If Mario is supposed to be squished, his action is changed to the  squished  action. Vertical Wind - If Mario is above a vertical wind floor, his action is changed to the  vertical wind  action. (This is due to the long jump action having the \"Allow Vertical Wind Action\" flag.) At this point, two more things happen prior to the long jump action: Mario's quicksand depth is set to 0. Mario plays a falling noise if he has fallen more than 1150 units from his peak. With the long jump action occurring, the following happens: If Mario's initial long jump was determined to be fast (more than 16 speed prior to the speed multiplier), the animation is set to the \"Fast Long Jump\" animation (0x13). Otherwise, it is set to the \"Slow Long Jump Animation\" (0x14). Mario performs the noises for the jump. If the floor under Mario is a vertical wind surface and Mario's \"action state\" is set to 0: Play the \"Here we go!\" voice clip. Set the \"action state\" to 1. Now, Mario performs the quarter-frame movement via a full  common air step .

{"prompt": "Explain Wing Cap", "completion": "Wing Cap Hitbox Info Hitbox cylinder with radius of 80 and height of 80, offset down 0 units Damage None Speed ??? Tangibility radius ??? Interaction type Cap Surfaces ??? Related Vanish Cap ,  Metal Cap Found In Bob-omb Battlefield ,  Lethal Lava Land ,  Shifting Sand Land ,  Tower of the Wing Cap ,  Wing Mario over the Rainbow ,  Castle Grounds For a tutorial on speedrunning the corresponding star, see the  Wing Cap RTA Guide The  Wing Cap  is a powerup that can be found in red [!] blocks after the red  cap switch  in  Tower of the Wing Cap  is pressed. When worn, it allows Mario to fly through the air after triple jumping or launching from a cannon and to fall slowly by holding the A button. It expires after 60 seconds.  Glitches The Wing Cap, like all caps, can be used to perform the  Hat in Hand  glitch. Also, landing right after beginning to fly will cause the camera to remain as if Mario was flying, i.e. it will constantly be directly behind Mario and the C buttons only change it temporarily. [1]  On the  Japanese version , this can also be done by simply pressing B or Z after triple jumping. There are numerous ways to undo this glitch: Getting knocked back by an enemy. Getting launched by a cannon. Stopping with flying. (To stop flying, one needs to start flying normally first.) Getting thrown by King Bob-omb. Riding a koopa shell. Catching on fire. Getting squished while standing. (Getting squished while moving won't undo the glitch) Swimming. Getting sucked into a tornado. Leaving a course in any way. Use in Challenges The Wing Cap can be used as a means of travelling quickly for the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , as flying gives you horizontal momentum. However, the Wing Cap cannot be obtained in a full-game run, as it requires looking up in the castle.

{"prompt": "Explain Upwarp", "completion": "An  Upwarp  is a phenomena where Mario's vertical position is suddenly updated so that he appears to warp upward. There are a few types of known upwarps. Tick Tick Clock Upwarp The Tick Tock Clock Upwarp  is an unsolved glitch occurrence where a player named Dota_Teabag encountered an upwarp in  Tick Tock Clock . As of 2023, the glitch remains unsolved. Hangable Ceiling Upwarp The hangable ceiling upwarp is an upwarp caused when Mario single jumps or double jumps into a ceiling at its edge, while under a higher hangable ceiling. This upwarps him to the higher ceiling, and he begins hanging on it.  Water Surface Upwarp Whenever Mario enters water, he is always warped to the surface of the water before he can swim. The upwarp effect is observeable in courses such as WF, TTM, and THI small island. However, a ceiling hitbox can immediately push him back down so that he never remains at the surface of the water. This is observable in WDW in downtown when the water level is overflowed."}

All forms of  MIPS Clip  are banned. Circumventing any castle door or star requirement via any other method is banned. Recommended Routes It is recommended, regardless of your skill level, to do some variant of the  HMC Late  route, which involves initially skipping HMC during basement and returning to it later as part of collecting the second MIPS star. The  HMC Early  routes are those that do HMC on the first (and only) trip to the basement, and so do not collect the second MIPS star. There are three options that are usually taken in this (HMC Late) route. They are independent, but in practice usually implemented in order of increasing skill level. Beginner : No TTC100 + CCM18 + No Island Hop This is the most basic route, though it is still possible to replace stars with slower and easier ones, as outlined in  General Route Variations . Intermediate : TTC100 + CCM18 + No Island Hop This is the de-facto standard route, most similar to  120 Star . It replaces  Shell Shreddin' for Red Coins  with the 100 coin star in  Stomp on the Thwomp (+ 100 Coins) , and is worth considering when reaching a level of consistency with the latter. This route is more consistent and typically done in races by advanced-level runners. Advanced : TTC100 + CCM17 + No Island Hop This route moves the CCM 100 coin star into  Slip Slidin' Away (+ 100 Coins) , and then replaces  Big Penguin Race  with  Pyramid Puzzle . This means it requires doing  pillarless  twice to save time, making it much more inconsistent. This route entails leaving Cool, Cool Mountain with 17 stars collected rather than 18, hence the name. Expert : TTC100 + CCM17 + Island Hop Shoot to the Island in the Sky  typically requires wing cap and so must be done after its unlock in  Tower of the Wing Cap . At top level, a hard trick known as  Island Hop  can be done to finish the level without the wing cap, and so it's moved to the start of the run, with the other Bob-omb Battlefield star. This skips backtracking to Bob-omb Battlefield later on and so saves time on castle movement. Overall, it's about 5\u20136s faster than the advanced route. These options will be flagged in the next section, which details the standard (HMC Late) route. HMC Late (Standard Route) Route Variations This route has three standard options, ordered by increasing skill level at which they are typically taken: No TTC100  vs  With TTC100 CCM18  vs  CCM17 No Island Hop  vs  With Island Hop These are explained in the previous section.

Optimally, these routes are comparable to the standard HMC late route, however they are generally considered harder to optimize. They may be preferable in some situations, since they allow more flexibility in routing from not being bound as tightly to the 30 star door requirement before DDD. Differences from HMC Late The differences between this route and the standard  HMC Late  route are as follows: After LLL, go directly to HMC. Get all of the HMC stars, then HMC Toad, and then proceed to DDD as normal. In SL, you'll have to get  Shell Shreddin' for Red Coins  to replace the second MIPS star. Once finished with SL, go to Tippy as normal instead of exiting the course. The route above is the most common HMC early route, but a few modifications can be made to make the route faster and/or more consistent.  Replacing CCM100 Since meeting the 30 star door requirement is not an issue with HMC Early, you are allowed more flexibility in early-game routing. Typically, people will replace  Big Penguin Race + 100 Coins  and  Slip Slidin' Away  with  Slip Slidin' Away + 100 Coins  and one alternative star. Also, since SL Reds already replaces the second MIPS star, you will need to add in another alternative star if you decide to skip TTC100. Easy/Slowest:  Navigating the Toxic Maze  without BLJ Intermediate:  Wiggler's Red Coins Hard/Fastest:  Pyramid Puzzle General Route Variations The following route variations apply to both the HMC early and HMC late routes. Star Substitutions Hard stars can be substituted for easier and slower ones. The most common substitution is  Stomp on the Thwomp + 100 Coins , replacing it with  Stomp on the Thwomp  on its own along with an additional alternative star from the list below. Another common substitution is  Cruiser Crossing the Rainbow  for another star from the list. Easy:  Shell Shreddin' for Red Coins   (if HMC Late, else this is already in the route) Easy:  Navigating the Toxic Maze  (no BLJ) Intermediate:  Wiggler's Red Coins Hard:  Pyramid Puzzle Island Hop See  the expert route  for an explanation. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e RTA Guide Platforms Nintendo 64  \u2022  Virtual Console  \u2022  Emulator Categories 0/1 Star  \u2022  16 Star  \u2022  70 Star  \u2022  120 Star  \u2022  31 Star  \u2022  50 Star  \u2022  All\u00a0!

{"prompt": "Explain Challenge", "completion": "A  Challenge  is a self-imposed restriction of performing certain tasks, making the completion of the game harder. Restrictions include the use of a certain button (the  A Button , for example), the use of cannons, collecting coins, and the use of caps, among others. Often, these challenges lead to the discovery of glitches, while some must be utilized to make up for a loss of a certain function. For example, restricting the A button forces Mario to use techniques such as frame-walking, enemy manipulation, and  cloning  to complete certain tasks. Collecting the 5 secrets in Bob-omb Battlefield coinless requires making a  Premature Clone  of the top coin and landing at the 30-unit high area to collect the secret without interacting with the center coin.

Additionally, enemies must not be interacted with (including Lakitu, but excluding Bowser and MIPS). The challenge was created by Mario64Masters. The name of the UBER Challenge was borrowed from Manocheese's \u00dcber Challenge for Ocarina of Time. There are 39 stars that can be collected RTA, and 46 stars are possible in a TAS run. Pacifist Challenge Main article:  Pacifist Challenge The Pacifist Challenge forbids any combat with enemies except for Bowser. Any actions that do not result in killing an enemy are allowed. The number of stars that can be collected is 98 glitchless, and 101 for TAS runs [1] . In a full game run, however, killing the Boo to enter  Big Boo's Haunt  is considered nonpacifist, cutting off the available 2 stars, and therefore the actual number of stars that can be collected is 96 glitchless and 99 with TAS. The following stars cannot be collected in the RTA pacifist run. BoB  (2):  Big Bob-omb on the Summit  (enemy),  Footrace with Koopa The Quick  (requires the previous star) WF  (2):  Chip Off Whomp's Block  (enemy),  To the Top of the Fortress  (requires the previous star) BBH  (7): All stars are cut off due to entering the course requiring killing a Boo. If entering the stage is allowed, then only two stars ( Secret of the Haunted Books  and  Seek the 8 Red Coins ) can be collected. HMC  (1):  HMC 100 coins  (only 92 non-enemy coins) LLL  (2):  Boil the Big Bully  (enemy),  Bully the Bullies  (enemy) SSL  (1):  Stand Tall on the Four Pillars  (enemy) SL  (1):  Chill with the Bully  (enemy), THI  (4):  Pluck the Piranha Flower  (enemy),  Rematch with Koopa the Quick  (requiring Star 1),  Make Wiggler Squirm (enemy) ,  THI 100 coins  (infinite coin glitch requires killing Piranhas) The following stars can be circumvented if glitches or TAS strategies are allowed: WF  -  Blast Away the Wall : A wall clip can be performed to reach the star cannonless. SSL  -  SSL 100 coins : 100 coins can be collected using infinite coin glitch, done by disappearing cork box glitch in the course. 86 non-enemy coins otherwise. SL  -  SL 100 coins : 100 coins can be collected with an infinite coin glitch, by activating  Time Stop  from the snowman and repeatedly collecting a nearby coin. 58 non-enemy coins otherwise. A Button Challenge Main article:  A Button Challenge The A Button Challenge aims to reduce the use of  A Button  in courses, first documented in  Curtis Bright's website . Since then, many techniques are applied in an attempt to bring down the A Press count, with  pannenkoek2012  being the biggest contributor to the challenge. There are 98 stars that can be collected on a full game basis without the A Button using TAS. A 120-star run of the game can be completed in 13. Coinless Challenge The Coinless Challenge's only rule is that the player cannot collect any coins. Specifically, no yellow, red, or blue coins can be collected. Techniques where Mario's coin score is saved as 0 coins by collecting multiples of 256, or pause buffering to prevent the coin counter from going up, are not allowed. Mario is able to collect 81 stars in a full game run, and 82 stars on a single star basis. The remaining 38 stars require collecting coins and are therefore impossible. Cannonless Challenge In the Cannonless Challenge, entering any cannons is forbidden. As it turns out, all 120 stars can be collected cannonless. The challenge was completed on 23 July 2018 by sm64expert, when he collected the  Wing Mario Over the Rainbow Red Coin Star . [2] Capless/Cannonless Challenge To qualify as capless, Mario cannot use any special caps except the cap effects obtained from the start of a course. To qualify as cannonless, Mario cannot use any cannons. Using the capless and cannonless ruleset from the UBER Challenge, every star except for one ( Wing Mario Over the Rainbow Red Coin Star ) can be collected, resulting 119 stars that can be collected. The most difficult stars to collect include: BoB  -  Shoot to the Island in the Sky ,  100 Coins ,  Find the 8 Red Coins : Going to the island can be done by long jumping from the top of the mountain. SSL  -  Free Flying for 8 Red Coins : Tornadoes, Fly Guys, and Klepto can help Mario collect the 4 aerial coins without the wing cap. Vanish Cap under the Moat : The cage can be reached by performing a side flip to a wall kick, removing the need of using a vanish cap. CCC Challenge Main article:  CCC Challenge The CCC Challenge combines Coinless with Capless/Cannonless. The restriction is extremely heavy, leaving very few stars that can be collected, as some of them inadvertently collect coins during the process. Mario is able to collect 81 stars in a full game run, and 82 stars on a single star basis. While this is the same number of stars collectible as Coinless Challenge, the workarounds are much harder to achieve. No Buttons Allowed/Buttonless Challenge Main article:  No Buttons Allowed Challenge The No Buttons Allowed Challenge forbids the use of A, B, Z, Start, L, R, and (to some extent) C buttons. This challenge was created by pannenkoek2012 to push the game to its limits. The C buttons are only allowed when they only affect the camera and don't affect actual gameplay. For example, the  C^ Hyperspeed  glitch is not allowed. The challenge is more difficult than simply restricting the A button, since this disables many maneuvering options that Mario can use, such as jumping, diving, sliding, and more. The challenge cannot be done as a full game run as there is in-game text that cannot be advanced without the use of buttons. There are only 34 stars that can be collected, many of which require complicated strategies. [3] ABZ Challenge Main article:  ABZ Button Challenge The ABZ Challenge is similar to Buttonless, but instead of restricting all buttons only restricts the three primary buttons, A B and Z. Instead of requiring that they don't be used at all, it allows simply using the minimum number of buttons possible. It was as an alternative to the Buttonless Challenge, since the Buttonless Challenge did not allow the start button, and consequently did not allow changing languages on PAL version to minimize text box button presses. Low Doors Challenge In the Low Doors Challenge, the game must be beaten while opening as few doors as possible. A door is considered used when the door opening cutscene occurs. Doors are skipped using BLJs and HSWKs, pause exiting, and routing to avoid moving between castle floors unnecessarily. Any% needs to open only 2 doors to complete: one door to enter the basement (using either the key door or moat door), and one door to enter the upper floors. 120 Stars needs to open 4 doors to complete: one to enter the basement (using either the key door or moat door), one to enter the upper floors, one to enter the courtyard for BBH, and one to exit the CCM slide level through the cabin. Unconfirmed door skips exist in BBH, HMC, and skipping the door to the endless stairs using HSWKs. The 50 star door stairs BLJ cannot be used for the latter, as Mario needs to stop at the 3rd floor to get all stars, and cannot pause exit out from the 3rd floor. No Joystick Allowed Challenge Main article:  No Joystick Allowed Challenge The No Joystick Allowed Challenge forbids the use of Joystick inputs, considered to be the inverse of No Buttons Allowed Challenge. As the joystick provides the vital function for Mario to change directions and run, the challenge takes route planning to the extreme. The challenge can only be done on a single star basis and not a full game run due to absurd limitations. There are only 55 stars that can be collected, many of which require complicated strategies. A related challenge is the  Low Joystick Magnitude Challenge , in which the joystick is allowed but the magnitude of the joystick is to be minimized. The value to be minimized can be either the largest joystick magnitude needed in a run or segment, or the total magnitude value integrated over the whole run. Floor is Lava Challenge The  Floor is Lava Challenge  disallows standing on floors that aren't part of objects. It was created by Timestoppa. Joke Challenges Some challenges have been created as jokes, and then actually been executed, such as Plush% (collecting specific stars to make the  STROOP  file menu spell out \"PLUSH\"). Another joke challenge: \"prove for as many actions as possible that they can transition into  Eaten By Bubba  in vanilla\". [4] Other challenges The  Same Input Challenge  is a challenge where the goal is to collect as many stars as possible using the same sequence of inputs.

{"prompt": "Explain Wooden post", "completion": "Wooden Post Hitbox Wooden Posts  are objects appearing in  Bob-omb Battlefield  and  Tiny-Huge Island . They can be ran around to release coins, and one post is attached to a  Chain Chomp  who is released when the post is ground-pounded 3 times.  Behavior When Mario ground-pounds a post, if it is not already being ground-pounded, a sound plays and the wooden post's Y-speed is set to -70. When the post is ground-pounded, its Y-speed increases by 25 every frame until it reaches 0. In practice, this means that the post drops by 45 units on the first frame and 20 units on the second and then stops moving. If the Wooden Post's Y-speed will put its Y-offset below -190 units, the post's Y-offset is set to -190 units and if a chain chomp is attached to the post, it is released. When Mario gets within 400 units of a post, a timer begins counting up. The game sets a variable for Mario's total angle to the post and each frame this is incremented by the value of Mario's current angle to the post minus his previous angle to the post. When this total angle reaches a value greater than 196,608 angular units (3 full angles), if the timer set is less than 200, 5 coins are spawned from the post. In practice this means that Mario must run around the post 3 times within 200 frames to get the coins. However, with TAS precision, Mario can achieve the total angle value needed while above the post in the air. Eru Post Eru Post  is a method to obtain coins from a Wooden Post without running around the post. The method works by having Mario jitter around in the air above the center of the post in a star pattern. By doing this, the game concludes that Mario has circled around the post several times and spawns the post's coins. This allows the coins to be spawned after a single jump kick or dive recover, making it much faster than the usual method. It is also possible to do a variation of Eru Post by low-magnitude walking on the post. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Objects Enemies Regular Amp  \u2022  Bob-omb  \u2022  Boo  \u2022  Bookend  \u2022  Bomp  \u2022  Bub   \u2022  Bubba  \u2022  Bullet Bill  \u2022  Bully  \u2022  Chain Chomp  \u2022  Chuckya  \u2022  Fly Guy  \u2022  Goomba  \u2022  Grindel  \u2022  Haunted Chair  \u2022  Heave-Ho  \u2022  Klepto  \u2022  Koopa  \u2022  Lakitu  \u2022  Mad Piano  \u2022  Moneybag  \u2022  Monty Mole  \u2022  Mr. Blizzard  \u2022  Mr. I  \u2022  Piranha Plant  \u2022  Fire Piranha Plant  \u2022  Pokey  \u2022  Scuttlebug  \u2022  Skeeter  \u2022  Snufit  \u2022  Spindel  \u2022  Spindrift  \u2022  Spiny  \u2022  Sushi  \u2022  Swoop  \u2022  Thwomp  \u2022  Tox Box  \u2022  Unagi  \u2022  Whomp Bosses King Bob-omb  \u2022   Big Boo  \u2022   Big Bully  \u2022  Bowser  \u2022  Eyerok  \u2022  Manta Ray  \u2022  Whomp King  \u2022  Wiggler NPCs Bob-omb Buddy  \u2022  Koopa the Quick  \u2022  Penguin  \u2022  Hoot  \u2022  MIPS  \u2022  Toad  \u2022  Ukiki  \u2022  Yoshi Other Objects Common Yellow Coin  \u2022  Blue Coin  \u2022  Red Coin  \u2022  1-Up Mushroom  \u2022  Bowling Ball  \u2022  Cannon  \u2022  Power Star  \u2022  Seesaw platforms  \u2022  Wing Cap  \u2022  Vanish Cap  \u2022  Metal Cap  \u2022  Elevator  \u2022  Sign  \u2022  Wooden post  \u2022  Cork Box  \u2022  Crazy Box  \u2022  Teleporter  \u2022  Warp Pipe  \u2022  Secret Level Specific Big Boo's Haunt tilting platform  \u2022  Merry-Go-Round  \u2022  Treadmill  \u2022  Pendulum  \u2022  Spinner  \u2022  Bowser Bomb  \u2022  Bowser key  \u2022  Grand Star  \u2022  Lethal Lava Land Drawbridge  \u2022  Tilted Inverted Pyramid Platform  \u2022  BitDW Trapdoor  \u2022  Controllable Platform  \u2022  Boulder Unused Boo key  \u2022  Bowser Anchor  \u2022  Fish spawner  \u2022  Trampoline  \u2022"}

There are two variants of the course, the \"tiny\" one and the \"huge\" one. In the level are many pipes which take you back and forth between the two. The level is themed around going from one world to another, and interacting with how the size changes affect the world. There are 2 paintings leading to THI, on the second floor behind a door with a star on it. One is a smaller painting which takes you directly to the tiny version of the course, and the other is a much larger painting that takes you to the huge version of the course Contents 1   Star Select Info 2   Tips 3   120 Route 4   70 Route 5   70 Route (with THI Reds) Star Select Info Act 1: No Koopa : When any star other than Rematch with Koopa the Quick (Star 3) is selected, neither Koopa the Quick nor his flag will spawn.

{"prompt": "Explain Out of Bounds", "completion": "Out of Bounds  ( OoB ) is any area where there is no floor triangle directly below Mario. The game cancels any movement that would place Mario OoB. Some glitches can be used to allow Mario to access OoB; this causes him to die instantly and temporarily become hatless. The reason behind Mario losing his hat during an out of bounds death is that the game checks whether Mario is in OoB and cancels Mario's actions if he is before checking whether he should have it on. As a result, Mario's body remains in its default setting, which is without his hat. [1] Because floors are carried into  Parallel Universes , there are in-bounds regions inside PUs that correspond to the in-bounds areas of the main map. This makes them useful for long-distance movement as in-bounds regions to be in between frames. Colliding with OoB When a movement into OoB is cancelled, Mario will appear to collide with OoB. This collision is different from those with  walls : Mario's angle is preserved (rather than reflected), and it is impossible to punch/kick or wallkick off OoB. Reaching OoB Some glitches can be used to allow the player to reach OoB. Doing so will instantly kill Mario. Recovering from a ledge grab into OoB. Forcing the only floor below Mario (i.e. a floor triangle of an object) to become intangible. Chuckya can throw Mario into OoB. Moving OoB by reading a sign clone. Warping via teleporter clone.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Rainbow Ride)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way.

Also the use of cap effects gained when entering a course are allowed. Stars Every Star in Super Mario 64 except  Wing Mario over the Rainbow Red Coins  is possible to obtain with these limitations. Some, however, require some non-trivial workarounds: BoB  -  Shoot to the Island in the Sky : Going to the island can be done by long jumping from the top of the mountain. WF  -  Blast Away the Wall : A precise ledge grab at the brick wall makes Mario clip into the wall slightly, allowing Mario to collect the star. This trick is known as \" Cannonless \" and is commonly used in RTA  speedruns . JRB  -  Blast to the Stone Pillar : The platform where the star is can be reached by precisely long jumping off the ship. You can also use a trick called  Frame Walking  to jump from one of the pillars. JRB  and  DDD  -  Through the Jet Stream : Mario can overcome the jet stream(s) by swimming efficiently, negating the need for the metal cap. HMC  -  Metal-Head Mario Can Move! : Mario can press the purple\u00a0! switch by falling onto it with enough vertical speed downwards instead of using the metal cap to walk underwater. DDD  -  Collect the Caps... : Mario is able to simply clone the star through the loading zone by bringing a  water shell  out of the water. This cloning process is similar to the one used in Quick Race through Downtown. (Note: Unconfirmed RTA possible) WDW  -  Quick Race Through Downtown! : The RTA viable method is to clone the star while holding a Chuckya. In a TAS run, Mario can perform a BLJ to build enough speed to clip into the cage. RR  -  Somewhere Over the Rainbow :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMMalU5yRvM&ab_channel=Ivan178 There are also 4 TAS only workarounds: BoB  -  Mario Wings to the Sky : You can use  Triple Jumps  with  Backwards Long Jumps  to gain enough speed and height to make it to all the secrets Capless/Cannonless. BBH  -  Eye to Eye in the Secret Room : Mario can clip into the secret room with  Hyper Speed Wall Kicks  until Mario reaches 400 speed, the minimum speed required to clip through a wall straight on. SL  -  Into the Igloo : Mario can perform a Low Ceiling BLJ to build speed at the entrance and navigate into the wall of the room leading to the star compartment. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Challenges Not Any Allowed Challenges Primary Challenges A Button Challenge  \u2022  Coinless Challenge  \u2022  Capless/Cannonless Challenge  \u2022  Pacifist Challenge  \u2022  No Joystick Allowed Challenge  \u2022  B Button Challenge  \u2022  Z Button Challenge Combined Challenges No Buttons Allowed Challenge  \u2022  CCC Challenge Insane Challenges UBER Challenge  \u2022  ABC CCC Challenge Lowest Use Challenges Challenges ABZ Challenge  \u2022  Low Doors Challenge  \u2022  Low Joystick Magnitude Other Challenges Other Challenges Floor is Lava Challenge  \u2022  Same Input Challenge  \u2022  Unsolved Single-Goal Challenges"}

This can allow the goomba to reach positions that would normally be too far from its home. This is used in  Jolly Roger Bay  to press the  Blue Coin Block  without using the A button by bouncing off the extended Goomba  [1] Goomba Escort Goombas normally cannot wak outside of a certain distance around their home, as they will then start turning back toward it. However, by having two goombas constantly collide with one another, it is possible for their target angle to keep updating without allowing them to turn fully, making them walk further and further away from their homes [2] [3] In December 2022, this trick was used to reach the mainland in  Tiny Huge Island  without using a  Star Dance Clip , making most stars of this level much faster [4] Scuttlebugs Scuttlebug Raising When a scuttlebug spots Mario, it turns towards him and lunges forward slightly. However, if the scuttlebug is deactivated during the lunge, the scuttlebug cannot fall down until it is reactivated. Upon spotting Mario and being reactivated, the scuttlebug will begin another lunge while still in the air from the previous lunge. By carefully moving back and forth in an area where the scuttlebug can be deactivated and reactivated, these lunges can be chained together so that the scuttlebug will gain arbitrary height in the air. This is notably used in the star  Watch for Rolling Rocks  in order to get to the high platform where the star is located. [5] Scuttlebug Transportation Scuttlebugs can normally only move within a certain range around their homes. However, when a scuttlebug hits Mario, his home because the point of interaction. This allows to transport a scuttlebug to a lot of otherwise unreachable location [6] This is used extensively in  Big Boo's Haunt  and  Hazy Maze Cave  for the  A Button Challenge Fly Guys Fly Guy Manipulation Fly Guys have two states, one where they will chase Mario, and one where they will return to their home. This state changes depending on how close the fly guy is to Mario laterally, the fly guy's height above Mario, and the angle between Mario and the fly guy. If a fly guy is far enough above Mario and facing him, the fly guy will be put in the state of chasing Mario, even if the fly guy is not active. By moving above the fly guy with careful timing, the fly guy will begin the action of lunging. If the fly guy is spinning while in the chasing Mario state, moving above the fly guy will make the fly guy stop spinning but activate its lunging action. In this way, the fly guy can be made to lunge toward Mario from wherever it currently is located.  [7] Fly Guy Size Manipulation When a fly guy is preparing to shoot fire at Mario, the fly guy will grow slightly, then shrink slightly before firing. However, by moving out of the fly guy's angle of fire repeatedly, the fly guy can be made to shrink infinitely, since the fly guy will shrink slightly more than it grows each time the firing timer is reset.

{"prompt": "Explain Trampoline", "completion": "Trampoline Hitbox Info Hitbox Collision involves triangles instead of a cylindrical hitbox Tangibility radius 1000 Interaction type None Surfaces 0x00 (default) The  Trampoline  (also known as the  Springboard ) is an unfinished and unused object in Super Mario 64. Its model and collision are nearly fully finished, but its code was apparently abandoned early on. The game contains infrastructure for the trampoline to affect Mario's jumps, and the trampoline has code for visually stretching and compressing. However, if you manage to load the trampoline into the game, it doesn't do anything other than act as a platform since there is no code to move it nor code to interface it with the existing trampoline infrastructure. Below, you can see an example of the trampoline as it is in the game, with no modifications. It does nothing visible. It does not stretch or squish itself. Code The trampoline is made out of 3 objects: the top, the spring, and the base. The base is a static object with no associated code. The top spawns the spring and the base, and sets a variable to whether Mario's on the platform or not (though this variable goes unused).   The trampoline as it is in the game, inert   The trampoline spring when forced to stretch; it doesn't line up with the trampoline, instead going below and above it The spring continuously updates to be 75 units under the top of the trampoline, and has the incomplete code to visually stretch/compress itself. The math is not complete; on the right, you can see the effects it has when it is forced to run. The errors are caused by the programmers putting 50 and 500 arbitrarily in place of 150 (the height of the trampoline), and not putting a simple line of code to correct the spring's apparent position. The lack of this code supports the hypothesis that the code was abandoned early on. When the aforementioned spring code is repaired and the trampoline top is made to lower when Mario gets on it, the intended compression effect can be seen. In Mario's main movement code, there are 3 useless functions. The first just returns zero, and the next two do nothing at all. The last function is called by the trampoline every frame. The zero function is called in the function that determines Mario's vertical speed when he single jumps, double jumps, triple jumps, sideflips, backflips, steep jumps, long jumps, wall kicks, jumps from a handstand, or shell jumps. This function takes in a constant initial vertical speed and a multiplier, and outputs the vertical speed plus Mario's forward speed times the multiplier (making it so that Mario's jumps go higher when he goes faster), plus the zero function. Interestingly, most of the jumps listed have a multiplier of 0, which makes the function mostly pointless (it's also responsible for making Mario jump lower when squished). Due to the zero function's proximity to the empty function called by the trampoline, it is plausible that the empty function was intended to make Mario code aware of trampoline, and the zero function was intended to return the additive vertical speed from the trampoline. When these functions are restored according to this hypothesis, and the broken spring compression is fixed, a fully functioning trampoline can be made.

{"prompt": "Explain ABZ Button Challenge", "completion": "ABZ Button Challenge Abbreviation ABZ Individual stars collectible 34 Overall stars collectible 0 Is beatable No Presses required for Any% 79 Presses required for 120-Star 614 Star Details BoB WF JRB CCM BBH HMC LLL SSL DDD SL WDW TTM THI TTC RR Secret Castle Bowser The  ABZ Button Challenge , also known as  the ABZ challenge ,  ABZBC , or  ABZ  for short, is a  challenge  in which the total sum of A, B, and Z  button presses  is minimized. For example, pressing the A button once is better than pressing B once and Z once or the B button twice, while pressing the Z button once is better than pressing the A button twice. The ABZ Button Challenge is unique in that it aims to minimize the sum of three values, rather than any of those values individually. For example, although it may be possible to obtain a  star   without pressing A , it is often the case that doing so requires many B presses; the converse holds as well. Thus, the way one approaches the ABZ Button Challenge is frequently very different from related challenges.   Textboxes  constitute a majority of the ABZ presses in current routes. Advancing through text requires pressing either the A or the B button, meaning that minimizing A, B, and Z presses also leads to minimizing the amount of text presented in-game. In the  European/PAL  version, the game's language can be selected after each  Save and Quit . Thus, in this version, one can change the game's language between English, German, and French without incurring any ABZ presses. Players use this mechanic in order to choose the language with the fewest textboxes at any given time. The best version of the game in the current route is the  PAL Wii VC  version because of  BitFS Platform Raising , which saves an A press in the any% run. The project was conceptualized by  User:Welcoe , with much of the current progress being made since early 2018. There are currently 2 spreadsheets for the ABZ challenge: the  TAS  spreadsheet [1]  and the  RTA  spreadsheet [2] . The current amount of ABZ presses is not yet confirmed, as the initial routing for the challenge is not yet complete.

Due to the lack of confirmation of how many ABZ presses are needed for the normal challenge, the number of ABZ presses needed for this challenge is not known either but should be significantly lower than normal.

To complete it, Mario must collect a  Power Star  inside a breakable wall by blasting into it with a cannon.  Contents 1   Challenges 2   TAS 2.1   TAS Strategy 2.2   TAS History 3   References Challenges Normally, A needs to be pressed in order to fire the cannon, however, this can be skipped by performing the  cannonless glitch  where Mario ledge grabs into the wall, causing his  hitbox  to touch the star. This also means the star can be done  cannonless . Due to the courses design, it is very easy to collect the star  without pressing any buttons , by simply walking up the slopes to reach the bridge. This star can also be collected  without using the joystick . [6]  This is done by heading to the owl, and controlling it by regrabbing it mid-air, which is possible through pausing to change the  global timer , then dropping down to the wall. It's also possible to wall kick directly into the star, meaning this can also be done  coinless . TAS TAS Strategy Mario heads toward the tree. He kicks and  sideflips  into the tree, then does a jump dive onto the wet area. He lands on the elevated edge, making him fall once he slides off, allowing him to immediately jump again. Mario does a  triple jump  onto the edge of the  wall  and performs a  glitchy wall kick  up to the star. Mario ledge grabs, extending his  hitbox  into the star's allowing him to collect it.

Once you approach the middle level, c-left to have a better view of the bottom level. Kick before the ground to avoid fall damage. Alternatively, you could dive rollout instead of double jumping down, however this is arguably more difficult and slower than the intermediate strat.

Mashing the A button after the backflip will ensure you wallkick but will make it so you don't reach the star platform. This movement loses 1-2s from the fastest strat. Mashing A+B will let you reach the top platform but you won't have much speed. This loses less than 1s to the pro strat. Load video Local File Local File might collect personal data.

{"prompt": "Explain Astral projection", "completion": "Astral Projection  is a glitch wherein the position Mario's model is drawn in (his graphical position) becomes separated from the position he's actually in (his physical position) for an arbitrary length of time. This glitch occurs when Mario grabs  Chuckya  while Chuckya is holding Mario. Chuckyas have a secondary object called the  anchor  which is positioned in Chuckya's hands and constantly sets Mario's graphical position to its own. As long as it thinks Chuckya is holding Mario, the anchor will \"anchor\" Mario's graphical position away, even though Mario's physical position is still at the location Chuckya grabbed him at. However, when Mario grabs Chuckya, the variable that determines whether Chuckya is holding Mario is not reset. Thus, Mario's graphical position will remain separated from Chuckya until Chuckya is killed or an external force causes Mario's position to be reset to his graphical position. To be able to grab Chuckya, Mario's  grabbed action  must be interrupted. There are three ways to do this: by being in water (cancelling the grabbed action into  Water Plunge ), by interacting with lava (cancelling the grabbed action into  Lava Boost ), and by interacting with a  Star  or  Bowser Key  (cancelling the grabbed action into a star dance action). This glitch cannot be performed with  King Bob-omb , even though all the above logic still applies, because King Bob-omb turns himself intangible when holding Mario and therefore cannot be grabbed. Contents 1   With Water 2   With Lava 3   With a Star 4   Videos With Water This article is in need of an image. You can help Ukikipedia by  adding images . Astral Projection with Water was the first type to be discovered, and can be performed in  Wet-Dry World ,  Tiny-Huge Island , and  Tall, Tall Mountain . Cancelling Mario's grabbed action with water allows Mario to almost immediately water-grab Chuckya, without the need to wait for another action to complete like with lava or a star. Another advantage of astral projection with water is that exiting water allows Mario to  hold Chuckya light  right away, which gives much more freedom in movement. With Lava This article is in need of an image. You can help Ukikipedia by  adding images . Astral Projection with Lava was the second type to be discovered, and can only be performed in  Rainbow Ride . It was initially discovered by ROMhack players in levels where Chuckya was placed near lava; however it is also possible using the lava in the fireplace in Rainbow Ride. With a Star This article is in need of an image. You can help Ukikipedia by  adding images . Astral Projection with a Star was the third type to be discovered, and has been shown to be possible in  Rainbow Ride  and  Bowser in the Sky , but is most likely possible in all other stages with Chuckya as well. In this method, Mario is grabbed by Chuckya while holding a cloned star (or otherwise made to collect a star while grabbed, such as by being moved into a star by a platform). The star must be a 100 coin star or Bowser course star so as to not kick Mario out of the level. Then, after the star textbox is closed, Mario can grab Chuckya. This glitch is not possible off-the-bat because Chuckya can usually only hold Mario for a maximum of ~58 frames (18 + an RNG-based timer from 11 to 40) before throwing him, which is just slightly too short for Mario's star dance actions to complete. However, if Chuckya is facing off an edge at the end of its usual spinning timer, it will postpone the throw for up to 16 frames to make it throwing Mario off an edge less likely. This extra time is enough to allow Mario to grab Chuckya.

{"prompt": "Explain Wall", "completion": "A  surface  or  triangle  in Super Mario 64 is a piece of geometry that exerts some kind of force or effect on Mario. Every triangle falls into one of three categories: a floor triangle, a wall triangle, or a ceiling triangle. However, a triangle does not store what category it is. Instead, its category is determined based on the y component of the triangle's  normal vector [1] . If y component > 0.01, then it is a floor. If y component < -0.01, then it is a ceiling. Otherwise, it is a wall. Contents 1   Walls 1.1   Hitbox 1.2   Non-vertical walls 2   Floors 2.1   Hitbox 3   Ceilings 4   Surface Types 5   References Walls A triangle is a wall triangle if and only if -0.01 < normal.y < 0.01. Hitbox   The hitbox of a wall during both the initial handle and a ground quarter step, simplified   The hitbox of a wall during an air quarter step, simplified   The hitbox of a wall in the water, including both the inital handle and the single frame movement, simplified All wall hitboxes are handled once per  frame  and once per  quarter step  of Mario's movement. Most of the time, a wall has two separate hitboxes handled one after the other within a frame or quarter step. A wall hitbox's initial frame handle has a hitbox extending 50  units  forward and 50 units backward, offset down 60, and then a hitbox extending 24 units in each direction offset down 30. A quarter step of ground movement has a hitbox extending 24  units  forward and 24 units backward, offset down 30, and then a hitbox extending 50 units in each direction offset down 60. This is the opposite order from the initial handle, but the outcome is the same. A quarter step of air movement gives the wall a hitbox of 50 units in each direction offset down 150, and then a hitbox of 50 units offset down 30. Water movement does not implement quarter steps. After one frame of water movement, a wall hitbox extends 110 units in each direction, offset down 10. Since both the water handle and the initial handle both happen once per frame, the hitboxes can be overlaid. Non-vertical walls   This wall in  BoB  is not quite vertical.  The majority of walls in the game are perfectly vertical, but not all. Walls that are not vertical are one cause of  Glitchy Ledge Grabs . Floors A floor triangle is a triangle with normal.y > 0.01. Hitbox A floor's hitbox extends 78 units below and 100 units above the floor triangle. This allows Mario to move vertically along floors; if he is moving up or down a slope or stairs, he will be off the floor after his horizontal motion but still in its hitbox, which will snap him to the floor. He will always be snapped up if he's in a floor's hitbox below the floor, but he'll only be snapped down while above a floor if he is in a ground movement state. When walking on a slope, Mario will move horizontally at a rate slower than his actual speed, known as his  De Facto Speed . Any location that is not inside or above a floor hitbox is considered out of bounds; Mario will not be able to move into it of his own volition, and if forced into it, he will die. Ceilings A ceiling hitbox extends from 160 units below the ceiling to infinitely above. For ground and air movement, the ceiling will try its best to keep Mario out of it. If Mario walks into the ceiling, his quarter step will be canceled, and he will remain in place and do the pushing animation. If Mario is moving upwards in the air when coming in contact with the ceiling, his quarter step will be canceled and his vertical speed will be set to 0. On the contrary, when Mario falls onto a ceiling while airborne, his quarter step will be canceled and his horizontal speed will get set to 0, making him fall straight down. Although a ceiling will extend upwards infinitely, a floor can overwrite the ceiling hitbox, meaning that its hitbox will stop right when the floor hitbox starts. On the American release of the game, there is an interesting ceiling example found in  Rainbow Ride , where  the top of the chimney is not capped off , making the ceiling go up forever, softlocking Mario if he ends up sliding into it. Even though ceilings try to push Mario outwards, they can still be accessed using various techniques, such as getting pushed by an enemy. Note that once Mario is standing inside the ceiling, he is no longer able to move anywhere due to his quarter steps being cancelled.  For Water movement, Mario instead gets warped downward by ceilings. These downwarps are used in various TASes and speedruns. Surface Types While the surface type of a surface is not restricted to only floors, walls, or ceilings, in practice they are only used in certain scenarios, or wouldn't have any affect if such surface was of a different type, i.e. there could be a vertical wind ceiling or a death barrier wall, but those surfaces would have the behaviour.

{"prompt": "Explain Straining", "completion": "Straining  is Mario's movement in the air. It involves how the joystick is angled relative to Mario's facing direction (which cannot be changed midair in most situations). Because of how the mechanic works, it can often result in a trade-off of speed vs distance. Contents 1   Technical Explanation 1.1   Forwards Movement 1.2   Sideways Movement 2   XX.99 Trick 3   Hyperspeed 4   Iwerlipse 5   References Technical Explanation When in the air, the game deals with Mario's intended movement in two directions- forward and sideways (when forward speed is negative, it indicates backwards speed). These two different directions behave differently from one another, although the two are not independent. The farther the joystick is held in a given direction, the less of the effect it has on the other. This is true all the way to the point where one direction is maxed, and the other direction is zeroed. The following calculations allow you to find what the effects of straining will be, but are not separate equations. Both equations are calculated at the same time and use the same values. This is why the two are not independent. Forwards Movement Forward movement is cumulative where some speed can be added to the forward speed. The maximum speed that can be added to forwards speed in a given frame is 1.15, although this depends on speed and type of air movement. The formula for forwards speed is- Forward Speed = Old Forward Speed + 1.5 * Stick Magnitude * cos(Angle from Forwards) \u00b1 0.35 - Drag Where  angle from forwards  is the angle from a vector straight forwards to the joystick direction, and  stick magnitude  is the magnitude of the stick being held divided by the maximum value. In other words, if the control stick is pushed all the way, the magnitude is 1. The \u00b1.35 always brings the speed towards 0, so minus when speed is positive and plus when the speed is negative. Drag depends on two things- whether or not Mario is long jumping and what his speed is after the stick magnitude and the speed's magnitude is reduced by 0.35. The values for drag are- Condition Drag Forwards Speed \u2264 32, Non-Long Jump 0 Forwards Speed > 32, Non-Long Jump 1 Forwards Speed \u2264 48, Long Jump 0 Forwards Speed > 48, Long Jump 1 Backwards Speed \u2265 -16 0 Backwards Speed < -16 -2 There's a couple important things to note from the drag table. Drag is never zero when considering the .35, you will always slow down if not straining. Drag is not linear, it only changes over certain barriers. The impact of this can create odd movement effects, like the 31.99 Trick. Lastly, the backwards speed drag when faster than -16 is so strong, you cannot actually accelerate faster than it. This creates a soft cap for backwards speed which prevents Mario from moving backwards fast (typically). Sideways Movement Sideways movement is a tad simpler than forward movement. Any sideways movement applied gives Mario sideways displacement, but not speed. This displacement is a max of 10 with pure sideways direction being held. The formula for sideways displacement is- Sideways Displacement = 10 * Stick Magnitude * sin(Angle from Forwards) Where  angle from forwards  is the angle from a vector straight forwards to the joystick direction, and  stick magnitude  is the magnitude of the stick being held divided by the maximum value. In other words, if the control stick is pushed all the way, the magnitude is 1. XX.99 Trick The  XX.99 Trick  is a way to maximize speed when moving forward or backwards in the air. Due to how drag works during forward movement, maximum forward magnitude can actually be slower than significantly smaller forward magnitudes. [1]  For example- Speed at the start of the frame (normal air movement)- 30.86 New speed with full magnitude-    31.01        (=Speed (30.86) + Stick Magnitude (1.5) - Drag (1.35)) New speed with a lower magnitude- 31.99        (=Speed (30.86) + Stick Magnitude (1.48) - Drag (.35)) Speed lost due to poor straining- 0.98 The barrier in the above case is 32 speed which dictates behavior. It is important to remember that drag is determined after the + stick magnitude - .35, which is why the component is different between the two situations. Essentially, using too much magnitude can push you over the drag threshold (32 here). Long jumping and backwards movement also have their own versions, 48 and -16 respectively. While the 32, 48, and -16 barriers would work for this purpose, it is not typically possible to hit them exactly and not go over. Because of this, the goal speed is usually to approach 31.99, 47.99, and -15.99 on the last frame before the barrier is hit. [2]  The table below breaks down which speed should be aimed for depending on your speed- Air State Speed Range for Trick Goal Speed for Trick Normal Forwards 30.85 \u2013 31.85 31.99 (32 exact) Long Jump Forwards 46.85 \u2013 47.85 47.99 (48 exact) Backwards -14.85  \u2013  -15.99 (-16 exact)* -15.99 (-16 exact) *Backwards air movement is capped at -16 speed This trick also allows \"free\" sideways movement, since the stick magnitude is not maxed. For this reason, if sideways air movement is beneficial, it should be done here. Hyperspeed Since you can continue to strain forwards unbounded, many different hyperspeed methods involve using the 0.15 acceleration per frame to build up large amounts of speed. Usually, Mario is somehow kept in an air action with something holding him in place, like a wall. These methods can only build forward hyperspeed, since they are achieved through forward straining. These methods cannot be used to get PU speed, since Mario will bonk on out-of-bounds, removing his speed. Hyperspeed  methods using this method include- Pedro Spot Hyperspeed Wall Kicking Hyperspeed Grinding Subframe Grinding Hyperspeed Jump Kicking Hyperspeed Slide Kicking Wiggler Hyperspeed Boo Hyperspeed Straining is also important for  Backwards Long Jumping . When starting to backwards long jump, it is important to maximize your negative speed at the start of the jump. This can be done by using the -15.99 trick. Holding maximum in the direction of movement will actually lower the speed every time -16 speed is passed, which can be incredibly costly given backwards long jumping's exponential behavior.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Jolly Roger Bay)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way.

Coins The 127 coins naturally collectible in this course are split up, with 89 coins outside and 38 coins inside the igloo. The max coin count for this course can be raised infinitely using  money bag duplication . This course also has a near \"impossible\" coin underneath the wooden walkway on the snowman. This coin has a fairly simple method of acquisition though, since shooting from the cannon while aiming at the lower portion of the walkway allows Mario to grab the coin. Without this coin, there are only 126 \"natural\" coins in the course.

To do this, Mario first lures it to a certain location from a certain angle. Then, he gets  shell hyperspeed , which is necessary to encompass the three zones necessary for proper manipulation, as the geometry of the course is mostly flat. After the manipulation, Mario ascends the snowman, reactivates Fly Guy, and bounces on it to reach the platform above, grabbing the star.

In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , every star except for  Into the Igloo  can be collected. They use Moneybag duplication and  Shell Hyperspeed  to gain height and distance. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , every star except for  Chill with the Bully  can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses.  Into the Igloo  requires clipping into the back of the igloo to avoid crawling inside. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Snowman's Big Head ,  In the Deep Freeze ,  Whirl from the Freezing Pond , and  Into the Igloo  can be collected. The latter requires  Hyperspeed Wall Kicking  to clip through the walls. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to reach a  Parallel Universe  in the igloo.

{"prompt": "Explain Infinite coin glitches - Moneybag Duplication", "completion": "Infinite Coin Glitches  are a category of glitches that allow Mario to collect infinite coins. Contents 1   Coin Cloning 2   Moneybag Duplication 2.1   Rapid Moneybag Duplication 3   Breaking-Disappearing Cork Box 4   Piranha Plant Glitch 5   Timestop 6   Ride Cancelling 7   References Coin Cloning Main article:  Cloning By grabbing an  object  as it  unloads , Mario can hold a fake object. A coin may load into the fake object's slot and Mario can then hold the coin. If the coin comes from a coin spawner, Mario can load the coin again by leaving and re-entering the coin spawner's radius, which would theoretically lead to infinite coins; however, each clone takes up an object slot, so unless a method of resetting the level such as a loading zone or sub-area is available, only a finite number of coins can be cloned before the object limit is reached and the game crashes. Moneybag Duplication Moneybag  duplication is a glitch which causes a Moneybag to duplicate itself into two Moneybags. By waking it up on the same frame it goes to sleep, you can cause it to create an awake one as well as an asleep one. Since these are technically separate objects, there are now two moneybags. Moneybag duplication can be used to get infinite coins in  Snowman's Land . In the  ABZ Challenge , extra moneybags are useful for some stars in  Snowman's Land  because you can bounce on them to get extra height. Rapid Moneybag Duplication This is a trick to duplicate the Moneybag rapidly. [1]  This was found by Tyler Kehne. The Moneybag will duplicate if Mario enters within 800 units of its home on the same frame that the Moneybag enters within 100 units of its home. So by oscillating in and out of this 800 unit radius, we can duplicate a new Moneybag every 2 frames. This technique should lead to faster SL 100 coin star times. One caveat though is that there is a 1/50 chance that the Moneybag's home will instantly translate 200 units to the side when awakening it, meaning that there's a 1/50 chance that the rapid duplication could come to an abrupt end. When going for a WR time, we'd need to get a better RNG sequence so that we could continue duplicating without this issue. Breaking-Disappearing Cork Box Main article:  Breaking-Disappearing Cork Box Glitch The breaking-disappearing cork box glitch is caused by breaking a  cork box  right when it disappears. This way it will respawn, but will also give three coins from breaking. The easiest way to do the glitch is to place the cork box on top of an object that becomes intangible when Mario moves away, and then returning to make the object tangible right when the box disappears. This method of infinite coins does not take up object slots, and so it can be used to create more coins than cloning would. Infinite coins via cloning would eventually crash the game. It is also possible to do this glitch while also grabbing the  cork box fake  by having the box break by touching the wall of a moving object. Piranha Plant Glitch The large  Piranha Plants  in  Tiny-Huge Island  can be used to collect infinite coins. By attacking the Piranha Plant on the last frame of it being out of the ground, then defeating it once it comes back up, reloading the area will make it reappear. This can be repeated indefinitely, but it is only possible in Tiny-Huge Island. Timestop Main article:  Timestop This method is only possible on the Japanese version of the game. It requires the player to be able to move around while most of the level is frozen because of a textbox. This is achievable in multiple ways, such as jumping at the same time as a proximity-based textbox is activated. In this state, coins can be collected but do not unload until time is resumed. The player can exploit this by stopping time, collecting a coin, and entering a warp zone. This means that the coin is collected but doesn't unload, so you can return to the area with the coin and repeat. Ride Cancelling Main article:  Ride Cancelling When Mario gets off of a shell, the game sends a \"signal\" that the shell uses to decide that it should unload. The \"getting off a shell\" signal overrides other signals, so if the player gets off a shell at the same time as collecting a coin, but the stop riding signal will prevent the coin from actually unloading. This process can be repeated by using a cloned shell, which allows for the shell to be reused multiple times.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Hazy Maze Cave)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way. No Joystick Allowed The 100 coin star is currently used to reset Mario's ascent of steep slopes, which is useful near the top of the pyramid in  Shifting Sand Land  to collect the stars  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  and  Pyramid Puzzle .

The maximum coin count that can be achieved in the castle in 999, by either exiting a level after getting 999 coins, or repeatedly collecting Castle coins and going out of the area and back in to respawn them. This list enumerates the unique coins that can be collected in the castle. Location Count (Outside the Castle) 2 yellow coins hidden underneath the bridge over moat 2 Total 2 Location Count (Inside the Castle) In the main entrance room, 2 pairs of coins beside the staircase 4 Total 4 Location Count (Castle Courtyard) 9 Boo Buddies (with yellow coins) 9 Total 9 Areas Castle Grounds The castle grounds are the starting location when creating a new file, loading a previous file, or dying anywhere within the castle. It features a sunny environment with birds and water sound effects in the background. There is also a cannon next to the lake that unlocks at 120 stars, which is meant to allow you to get onto the castle roof. However, it can be bypassed with precise movement. On the roof, if you have 120 stars,  Yoshi  tries to maximize Mario's lives to 100. There is one secret stage on the castle grounds,  Vanish Cap Under the Moat , which is usually entered by draining the most but can be entered by hyperspeed. Castle Lobby First Floor The first floor is the introductory area of the castle. It contains 4 main courses ( Bob-omb Battlefield ,  Whomp's Fortress ,  Cool, Cool Mountain , and  Jolly Roger Bay ), and three secret courses ( The Princess's Secret Slide ,  The Secret Aquarium , and  Tower of the Wing Cap ). The star door on this floor requires 8 stars to open and leads to  Bowser in the Dark World , the first Bowser stage. The door can be skipped with an  LBLJ , by  HSWKing , or with speed conserved from  Bob-omb Battlefield . [1] [2]  Additionally, there is a key door to the second floor, as well as one leading to the basement (the intended next area) and a regular warp door leading into the courtyard. Basement The basement has 4 main courses ( Shifting Sand Land ,  Lethal Lava Land ,  Hazy Maze Cave , and  Dire, Dire Docks ). It also contains the pillars normally required to unlock  Vanish Cap Under the Moat , although they can be bypassed with moat door skip. The star door in this area requires 30 stars which can be skipped with an  SBLJ , and leads to the second Bowser stage,  Bowser in the Fire Sea , and Dire, Dire Docks. Second Floor Just like the others, the second floor has 4 main courses ( Tall, Tall Mountain ,  Wet Dry World ,  Snowman's Land  and  Tiny-Huge Island ), along with a star door that requires 50 stars to enter, which leads to the third floor. The door can be skipped using  BLJs  or  HSWKing . Third Floor The third floor contains 2 main courses,  Tick Tock Clock  and  Rainbow Ride , along with one secret stage,  Wing Mario over the Rainbow . Although there are \"endless\" stairs on this floor that require 70 stars to pass, they can easily be skipped using  BLJs . These stairs lead to the final Bowser stage,  Bowser in the Sky . Courtyard The courtyard is the location of  Big Boo's Haunt , whose entrance is hidden inside the  Courtyard Big Boo . There are 9 other regular Boos in the Courtyard, spawned by  Courtyard Boo Spawners . If the player has less than 12 stars, the regular Boos do not spawn, and the Big Boo spawns but immediately despawns itself. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge ,  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , and  CCC Challenge , all stars and stage entries are possible. The Castle provides a huge roadblock for the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge  and  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , as doors and high paintings block most stage entries in those challenges. None of the five stars within the castle can be collected in either challenge. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all five stars can be collected. All stages can be entered with the exception of  Big Boo's Haunt , which requires killing a  Boo  to enter. In the  B Button Challenge , the Castle requires two B presses to grab  MIPS  both times, as well as an additional three B presses on the JP 1.0 version to talk to the three  Toads . All stages can be entered. In the  Z Button Challenge , all stars and stage entries are possible. Entering  Vanish Cap under the Moat  requires PU movement to skip pounding the two pillars. In the  UBER Challenge , the first MIPS star can be collected, as MIPS is an exception to the UBER Challenge rules. The second MIPS star cannot be collected as there are not enough possible stars to unlock it.  Big Boo's Haunt  cannot be entered, as it requires killing a Boo.  Whomp's Fortress  also cannot be entered, as  Lakitu  talks to Mario when entering the course. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in the Castle: reaching a  Parallel Universe  in the basement, upstairs, or courtyard, hanging below the entrance bridge with the water raised, and accessing the upper floors without collecting the key from Bowser.

Although the challenge is now over as there are no more stars that are possible to collect, it remains one of the early pieces of development in exploring the mechanics of Super Mario 64, as object-clipping,  BLJing , and advanced wall kicking are required to work around the restrictions. Ruleset The rules were as follows: Any coins should NOT be collected. No collecting or activating 1up mushrooms (lives). No gathering \"collectibles\" of 5. (Chests are allowed as there are only 4 of them). No pressing any switches (e.g. Purple switches, cap switches). No shooting from cannons. No using teleporting spots. Never lose your cap. Never wear any of the three special caps (except for when Mario automatically wears the wing cap when you finish the game). Boxes cannot be opened unless there is a star inside. No deaths. No damage from ANYTHING EXCEPT large falls and water. You can regain health from anything that is allowed. No activating the motion of any movable platform (including elevators) except those whose central position cannot be changed. Allowed: Seesaws, rocking platforms and the falling block in the volcano. Any other platform may be used if the way you use it does not affect its motion (like sets of 4 cycling checker blocks). No using the switches in Wet-Dry World to change the water level. Dorrie cannot be touched, nor can any penguin. Excluding scenes at the start and end of the game, the only characters you can talk to are  MIPS  and  Bowser . Lakitu cannot be talked to. This includes the beginning of  Whomp's Fortress . Levels where Lakitu is not speaking ( Bob-omb Battlefield  and  Lethal Lava Land ) are allowed. Updrafts may not be activated. Side drafts may be used as long as they do not blow off your cap. No combat with anything except Bowser and MIPS. Enemies may not be killed even if it is not directly an act of Mario. This includes enemies falling off an edge as well. You may only continue if it lands on a platform Mario can walk on glitchless. No touching any enemy (except Bowser or MIPS). A Thwomp, Grindel or Spindel is not an enemy as it is basically a moving platform. (You still must not get hurt by it) No entering any warp pipes in Tiny-Huge Island. Hacks are COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN (savestates are only allowed when practicing) No touching the cartridge or power cord intentionally while playing. Any version of the game is allowed (except  DS ). At least 15 stars must be collected before entering Dire, Dire Docks. You must get the star \"Board Bowser's Sub\" in Dire, Dire Docks. (This is to prevent  Side BLJ  skip from being used to skip directly to  Bowser in the Fire Sea ) Number of stars that can be collected There are 40 Stars that can be completed in RTA (Real Time Attack), where savestates are not allowed.

If the former is allowed, then  Shoot into the Wild Blue ,  Fall onto the Caged Island , and  Blast Away the Wall  can be collected. If the latter is allowed, then  Secret of the Haunted Books  can be collected. With TAS, there are seven more stars that can be collected under these restrictions. These stars do not count towards the original UBER challenge since they are nearly impossible to perform RTA. The numeric orders are according to the time the strategy was found: 40th star - HMC:  Metal-Head Mario Can Move!

{"prompt": "Explain Emulators", "completion": "Emulators  are programs with the purpose of simulating certain consoles on a PC and exist for nearly every console on the market. The most common  Nintendo 64  emulators are Project64 and Mupen64Plus, with Mupen64Plus being used as a core in the popular Retroarch multi-system emulator. N64 Emulators Mupen64 was originally released on December 10th 2001. It was designed to support multiple operating systems like Linux and Windows, and ports have been created for FreeBSD and MacOS, among others. Though the main emulator does not have TASing capability, many forks of it exist, one of which is  Mupen64-RR . Mupen64-RR is the emulator of choice for creating TASes of  Super Mario 64 Bizhawk is a multi-emulator program started in 2012 that can emulate most consoles, including the N64. Bizhawk is also used for making TASes, but it has inaccurate emulation. However, it is preferred over Mupen64 on  TASVideos  because it standardizes loading times. Mupen64 TAS movies can be converted into Bizhawk TASes. Bizhawk's N64 emulation is based on  Mupen64plus , a fork of Mupen64. Project64 is used to play most N64 games and  Super Mario 64 ROM hacks , but has no TASing capability. Project64 versions v1.6 and v1.6.1 are the only versions of the emulator allowed in Super Mario 64  speedrunning  communities, while versions v2.x are usually banned."}

It consists of a room fully filled with water; it contains 40  yellow coins  that can be used to refresh Mario's air. There are also 8  red coins  that must be collected to spawn a star. It is the only stage to have an (albeit implicit) time limit, as you cannot resurface and there are a limited amount of coins you can use to refresh your air. Contents 1   A Presses 2   Other Challenges 3   Coins 4   References A Presses Although the stage itself does not require any A presses, as it can easily be done by swimming with the B button, entering the aquarium is a challenge on its own. The current strategy used is very complicated. Because the final  text redirection  is done using a door that requires 1 star, the whole strat has to be done without collecting a single star. We have to enter  Bowser in the Dark World , get the basement key, and go to  Shifting Sand Land . Once in there, the TAS creates a setup using various objects found in the course to make sure Mario gets the right angle and speed for the lobby movement.

{"prompt": "Explain King Bob-omb", "completion": "King Bob-omb Technical Constants Object Group General Actor Actor Group Group 3 Draw Distance 4000 Physical Constants Gravity -400 Friction 1000 Buoyancy 200 Hitbox Interaction Type Grabbable Health 3 Radius 100 Height 100 King Bob-omb  is a large, mustachioed  Bob-omb  who resides on top of the mountain in  Bob-omb Battlefield . He challenges Mario to a battle after Mario reaches the top of the mountain and gives a  Star  upon being defeated. Unlike other Bob-ombs, he does not attack by blowing up. Instead, he tries to pick Mario up and throw him. Behavior King Bob-omb starts off intangible with his HP set to 3. When Mario gets within 500 units of King Bob-omb laterally, King Bob-omb\u2019s dialogue plays and he becomes holdable. King Bob-omb moves around with a forward velocity of 3 and turns towards Mario at a rate of 1.4 degrees/frame. If King Bob-omb manages to grab Mario, an animation of the grab plays and a sound plays. When the animation ends King Bob-omb starts moving forward at 3 units/frame,  and after 20 frames starts rotating towards the negative Z-axis at 5.625 degrees/frame. Once King Bob-omb is facing the negative Z-axis, he throws Mario. If Mario is within 2500 units of King Bob-omb, King Bob-omb begins walking around again. Mario can break out of the grab if he performs the grab escape action 11 times before he is thrown. When Mario grabs King Bob-omb and throws him, King Bob-omb is moved upward by 20 units, and then thrown forward with a Y-velocity of 50 units/frame and horizontal velocity of 20 units/frame. It takes 25 frames for the throw to complete, during which King Bob-omb will travel 500 units horizontally. If King Bob-omb was not thrown off the top of the mountain, then when King Bob-omb collides with the ground, his heath is decreased by 1, and, if he has not been defeated, his interaction type is changed to Hurtbox until he gets back up. If his health has hit 0, he is defeated, a star spawns, and the boss music stops. If King Bob-omb is thrown off the hill (more than 100 units below his home), then King Bob-omb jumps back up to the hill. If at any point during the battle Mario\u2019s height is at least 1200 units below King Bob-omb\u2019s height, King Bob-omb resets to his initial state and the boss music stops playing.

{"prompt": "Explain Bullet Bill", "completion": "Bullet Bill Technical Constants Object Group General Actor Actor Group Group 1 Model ID 0x54 Physical Constants Gravity 0 Friction 0 Buoyancy 0 Hitbox Interaction Type Damage Damage 3 Radius 50 Height 50 Down Offset 50 Code Initialization Behavior Script   [1] Behavior Code   [2] Bullet Bill  is an enemy that appears in  Whomp's Fortress  after defeating King Whomp. Bullet Bills are fired from a Bullet Bill Blaster at the top of Whomp's Fortress and attack Mario by flying into him. They deal 3 damage and cannot be defeated. Behavior The Bullet Bill Blaster is purely visual, as the Bullet Bill itself handles all its movement and is simply placed in such a spot to give off the illusion that the Blaster is firing it. The Bullet Bill is initialized with a velocity of 0 and positioned at its home.  If Mario is within 45 degrees of the Bullet Bill\u2019s line of sight and his distance from the Bullet Bill is between 400 and 1500 units, the Bullet Bill Blasting action will begin. The Bullet Bill moves forward at 3 units/frame for 40 frames, then alternates moving backward 3 units and forward 3 units per frame for another 10 frames. At frame 50, the bullet bill firing sound plays, the Bullet Bill smoke spawns, and the Bullet Bill begins moving forward at 30 units/frame. After 71 frames, the Bullet Bill is able to interact with walls and running into one will make it disappear and reset to its original position. If Mario\u2019s distance from the Bullet Bill is greater than 300 units, the Bullet Bill will rotate its angle toward Mario at 1.4 degrees per frame. After an additional 100 frames, the Bullet Bill disappears into mist and is reset to its initial state and position. If the Bullet Bill strikes Mario, the Bullet Bill becomes intangible and flies backwards at 30 units/frame while moving upward 20 units/frame and rotating. After 90 frames, the Bullet Bill is reset to its initial state and position.

It can be accessed from the painting in the rightmost room of the first floor of Princess Peach's castle. The door leading to it requires at least 3 Power Stars to be opened.

Keep in mind that if there are any blue stars (uncollected) present in the star selection menu, then the last version that can be selected is the first blue star and not the stars after it: Version 1 : Accessed by selecting Star 1. The ship is sunken under water, and the eel will be hiding in it. Additionally, there will be fog above the water in this version. Version 2 : Accessed by selecting Star 2. The ship is floating at the surface of the water, and the eel is relocated at a hole. Bob-omb Buddy is available to talk to, allowing the cannon to be unlocked. Star 2 and 6 are also now collectable. Version 3 : Accessed by selecting Star 3 through Star 6. This is version 2, with the exception that the eel will always be swimming around, without a star on its tail. Coins Jolly Roger Bay has one of the smallest coin counts in the game, which makes the 100 coin star in this stage extra difficult. Without advanced maneuvering, it is impossible to even get 100 coins without raising the ship, and missing a single blue coin can force a player to try again. This stage also lacks any coin duplication glitches, which leaves its total max at 104.

Entering Jolly Roger Bay  (0x) Video:  \"SM64 - Castle Movement - A Presses\"   Performing a dive recover allows entering the painting without pressing A. Plunder in the Sunken Ship  (0x) Video:  \"SM64 - Plunder in the Sunken Ship - 0x A Presses\"   Due to the requirement of not pressing A, the player can only swim by pressing B with the maximum speed of 7, and therefore navigating the water requires a lot of caution. Mario can optionally pick up the shiny shell to increase swimming speed and conserve it by precise B presses. With the aid of the surface above and a ring of coins close to the ship, luring the eel out is easy. Once Mario is inside the sunken ship, the most difficult part is collecting the star in the item block without pressing A since the star is 377 units above the floor [1] . Frame-walking is required to walk up the nearby steep slopes. Then, Mario falls into the spot slightly below the item block, and ground pounds it to collect the star. Can the Eel Come Out to Play?  (0x) Video:  \"SM64 - Can the Eel Come Out to Play? - 0x A Presses\"   The star can be collected easily by swimming to the tail end of Unagi the eel, though it is slightly more difficult to do so because the swimming is much slower without pressing A. Treasure of the Ocean Cave  (0.5x) Video:  \"SM64 - Treasure of the Ocean Cave (0.5x)\" After opening the chests, Mario gains hyperspeed on a semi-submerged sloped floor through rapidly kicking, and can build enough speed to reach the star with a kick on top of the rock nearest to it. Red Coins on the Ship Afloat  (0x) Video:  \"JRB Red Coins on the Ship Afloat 0x A Presses\"   The 5 red coins outside the ship are easy to collect. The biggest problem is the 3 red coins on the ship. When the ship oscillates on water, there is a very small window where the edges of the ship can be frame-walked on as they become steep floors, instead of walls and ceilings the pushes Mario out or prevents his movement, respectively. After walking onto the ship, Mario can then collect the remaining red coins and get the star. Blast to the Stone Pillar  (0x) Video:  \"JRB Blast to the Stone Pillar 0x A Presses\"   Mario needs to reach the stone pillar platform with the item block containing the star by going off a nearby pillar. To do so, Mario needs to build and conserve enough speed to go up the pillar and cross the gap. Two major breakthroughs lead to the method of reaching the star without using an A press. The first one is having enough speed to land on the platform from the top of the pillar without pressing A. The second one is building up speed using the pillar and conserving it using  speed conservation  tricks. To generate such speed, Mario first frame-walk up the pillar and slide down into the water. Next, Mario generates the remaining speed by first restoring the speed it accumulated (via Z+C^, a speed conservation tactic), and then uses Hyper Speed Punching by standing on an ascending slope of a certain angle while punching. After punching, Mario immediately dives right back into the water to conserve the gained speed. Altogether, a maximum of 150 speed can be reached. Finally, Mario restores the conserved speed and quickly ascends the pillar and dives to the platform at the top.  Through the Jet Stream  (0x) Video:  \"SM64 - Through the Jet Stream - 0x A Presses\"   Mario needs to collect the Metal Cap to not getting pushed away by the stream. The Metal Cap is required to bypass the obstacle, as otherwise, Mario cannot swim fast enough through the stream without pressing A. To break open the Metal Cap without A presses, Mario needs to dive recover off a rock with speed and ground pound precisely. Then, Mario needs to stand at a subpixel-perfect position (x = 4979.16, z = 2481.86) to avoid getting pushed out sideways by the stream in order to collect the star in the center. JRB 100 Coins  (0x) Video:  \"JRB 100 Coins 0x A Presses\"   With only 104 coins available in Jolly Roger Bay, getting 100 of them for the Power Star requires a lot of tricks. The first trick is getting onto the ship with the aforementioned frame-walk method. This is required as there are 3 red coins on the ship, and collecting them is necessary to get the needed 100 coins. The second trick is Goomba's extended chase, in order to have a Goomba getting closer to the blue-coin block. This is required so that Mario can gain enough height to bounce on the Goomba, and then ground-pound the blue-coin block to get all blue coins. In short, Pannenkoek exploits the fact that a Goomba's target angle is recalculated while chasing Mario by either making a Goomba walk into a ledge, colliding with another Goomba, walking onto a steep slope, or bumping into a wall, thereby extending the chase further than intended  [2] . Using this method, Pannenkoek manipulates one Goomba by repeatedly making them bump into a steep slope of a rock and the wall, and then he manipulates the other Goomba to run into the same obstacles plus the previous Goomba, allowing Mario to use the Goomba to ground-pound on the blue-coin block. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge , with  Blast to the Stone Pillar  requiring precise jumps and  Through the Jet Stream  requiring efficient swimming. In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected, as they all require swimming. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , only  Treasure of the Ocean Cave  can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. The JP 1.0 version requires precise jumps to reach  Blast to the Stone Pillar . In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 1 Z press, to ground pound the  Blue Coin  block. In the  UBER Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. In the  Floor is Lava Challenge , every star except for  Treasure of the Ocean Cave  and  100 Coins  can be collected. It is possible to do a jump kick immediately when starting the level and land on a sign, then jump into the water. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: getting more coins than intended, moving during  time stop , and reaching a  Parallel Universe  from inside the sunken ship.

It is composed of a head with a maximum of 4 body parts. To kill Pokey, the head must be killed. Pokey drops a blue coin upon defeat. Behavior Pokey begins in an uninitialized state. When Mario comes within 2000 units of Pokey, Pokey\u2019s 5 body parts are spawned at y-offsets of 480, 360, 240, 120 and 0. If Mario\u2019s distance from Pokey goes past 2500, Pokey returns to its home and goes back into the uninitialized state. If Pokey is missing a body part, a replacement part spawns after 100 frames. If Mario is more than 2000 units from Pokey, Pokey wanders around randomly. Specifically, Pokey moves with a forward speed of 5 units per frame with its movement angle being randomly increased or decreased by 45 degrees.

[26] Moat Door Skip The central glitch, known as  Moat Door Skip  or  MDS  was theorized by  Tyler Kehne  in mid-2015 when it was discovered the source of PU's crashing on console was the camera, and simply locking the camera was enough to access PU's on console. [27]  MDS was revealed to the public when  sonicpacker  uploaded a video showcasing it. [28]  The technique involves using  PU  movement to navigate in front of the door under the moat with 0 stars, exploiting the facts that PUs have no water and that the door-opening action takes precedence over entering the water within the course of a frame. Most of the original TASing for the first MDS was done by sonicpacker, although Tyler Kehne TASed the actual PU movement. Zig-Zag Strat Originally, the route for the negative jump into VCutM was done using what was called the \"Zig-Zag Strat\". This technique was decently optimized prior to the current BLJ location being found (which obsoleted this technique). Reason for Delay of the Full Run The first ever TAS of 1 Key was released on September 29th, 2016 with a time of 4\u201921\u201d67, which came more than a year after the original reveal. This was due to the fact that getting QPU speed requires visiting  Vanish Cap under the Moat  to perform an  elevator-BLJ . Visiting VCutM without draining the moat originally required 10 stars to get the  wing cap  for  hyperspeed flying , which was slower than just getting 8 stars, visiting the basement, and draining the moat normally (which made it slower to do this trick). Later, however, a BLJ on the  castle grounds  was found that sufficed to enter VCutM. Current Record The current record for the 1 Key TAS stands at 4:15.75. Since this skip saves the time normally required for the first Bowser level, this TAS holds the world record for the fastest known completion of Super Mario 64. Notability of being performed on J Version Unlike many other categories, the 1 Key run is optimally performed on the  Japanese version  of the game instead of the  US version . This is due to  Peach  not narrating her dialogue in the Japanese version, which saves more time than the longer in-game text costs. This time save is emphasized due to MDS skipping both the castle entry textbox and the BitDW textbox, both of which are longer on the Japanese version. Therefore, this run is  not  performed on the Japanese version because of version-exclusive glitches; it is performed on the Japanese version because the introduction is faster. Explanation/Commentary Castle Grounds First, Mario performs a  slope BLJ  to gain speed in the castle grounds. Once Mario's  intended next position  is in the  ceiling  under the bridge, he continues BLJing, but it acts like a  low ceiling BLJ  instead. At this point, Mario has enough negative speed to  negative jump  past the grate into VCutM. VCutM Mario quickly falls down to the elevators. He then sets the camera to  fixed cam  to avoid  a crash on console . Mario BLJs in order to get QPU speed (enough speed to perform  PU movement ). Since the elevator begins to turn, this allows Mario to use it get massive vertical  platform displacement , which triggers the death barrier. Normally level death resets speed, but because Mario spawns in using a water exit, he is able to conserve his  sliding speed . Then, by pressing Z to slide and C^ to conserve speed on the first frame on Mario is on ground (as water does not update sliding speed), he conserves his QPU speed into the castle grounds. Mario then navigates to the moat door's relative location in PUs, which he can do since PUs lack water. The game checks whether Mario should enter a door before it checks if he should swim, which allows Mario to open the door (from behind) when he navigates back to the main map. Castle Basement Mario rapidly swims through the basement and slides down to the 30 Star door area. He performs an  SBLJ  on the stairs, gaining enough speed to skip  Board Bowser's Sub  completely, and lands instead in  Bowser in the Fire Sea . Bowser in the Fire Sea Mario traverses the beginning of the level, using the  Hangable Ceiling Upwarp  glitch to pass the pole. On the elevator, Mario performs an elevator BLJ to gain QPU speed. Then, Mario travels through a PU and performs an  overflow jump , making use of high negative vertical speed to snap to the area with the bob-ombs (in a PU), before navigating into the warp for the Bowser fight. Bowser Fight When  the stage  is tilted, Mario BLJs to gain a large amount of speed. With this speed, Mario is able to move farther after grabbing  Bowser 's tail than normal, which places them closer to the  mine  than would otherwise be possible. After beating Bowser, Mario enters and pause-exits out of  Dire, Dire Docks  to quickly return to the castle lobby. Castle Upstairs Mario uses a ledge grab to quickly get up the first set of stairs. Although it is not visible on camera, Mario then performs a Side BLJ to gain speed. He clips through the 50 Star door. Mario then performs \"Clock Punch\", described here (scroll down) [29] . He then uses wall kicks to navigate past the  Endless Stairs  and into  Bowser in the Sky . Bowser in the Sky Using a glitch known as squish cancel, Mario is able to redirect momentum from a BLJ vertically, allowing him to fly to the final elevator, and clip into the final Bowser pipe with another BLJ. Final Bowser Fight Mario fights Bowser as normal. At the end, Mario uses speed conserved from a BLJ to grab the  Grand Star  faster. Notes \u2191   Hex edited by jongyon; never officially published.

{"prompt": "Explain 1 Star", "completion": "0 Star  and  1 Star  are currently the fastest RTA-viable routes for beating the game. Both categories use a series of  BLJs  to access the Bowser stages early and finish the game with a minimal number of stars. Beating the game with 0 stars requires a precise, speed-dependent SBLJ setup to skip DDD, so the 1 star route is recommended for beginners; however, if you are new to running this game, it is recommended to learn  16 Star  before attempting these categories. Route The routes are shown combined here, since they are largely the same aside from skipping DDD or not. It is recommended to learn the basic SBLJ and do 1 star first as it is considerably simpler than the DDD Skip setups.

By touching any of the  crystal taps  in the course, the water level is raised or lowered to the height of the tap used. Additionally, Mario's height as he enters the painting determines the water level immediately after entering the course (low, medium, or high). The course has a tunnel with a loading zone to take Mario back and forth between the main area and \"downtown\".

{"prompt": "Explain Ceiling", "completion": "A  surface  or  triangle  in Super Mario 64 is a piece of geometry that exerts some kind of force or effect on Mario. Every triangle falls into one of three categories: a floor triangle, a wall triangle, or a ceiling triangle. However, a triangle does not store what category it is. Instead, its category is determined based on the y component of the triangle's  normal vector [1] . If y component > 0.01, then it is a floor. If y component < -0.01, then it is a ceiling. Otherwise, it is a wall. Contents 1   Walls 1.1   Hitbox 1.2   Non-vertical walls 2   Floors 2.1   Hitbox 3   Ceilings 4   Surface Types 5   References Walls A triangle is a wall triangle if and only if -0.01 < normal.y < 0.01. Hitbox   The hitbox of a wall during both the initial handle and a ground quarter step, simplified   The hitbox of a wall during an air quarter step, simplified   The hitbox of a wall in the water, including both the inital handle and the single frame movement, simplified All wall hitboxes are handled once per  frame  and once per  quarter step  of Mario's movement. Most of the time, a wall has two separate hitboxes handled one after the other within a frame or quarter step. A wall hitbox's initial frame handle has a hitbox extending 50  units  forward and 50 units backward, offset down 60, and then a hitbox extending 24 units in each direction offset down 30. A quarter step of ground movement has a hitbox extending 24  units  forward and 24 units backward, offset down 30, and then a hitbox extending 50 units in each direction offset down 60. This is the opposite order from the initial handle, but the outcome is the same. A quarter step of air movement gives the wall a hitbox of 50 units in each direction offset down 150, and then a hitbox of 50 units offset down 30. Water movement does not implement quarter steps. After one frame of water movement, a wall hitbox extends 110 units in each direction, offset down 10. Since both the water handle and the initial handle both happen once per frame, the hitboxes can be overlaid. Non-vertical walls   This wall in  BoB  is not quite vertical.  The majority of walls in the game are perfectly vertical, but not all. Walls that are not vertical are one cause of  Glitchy Ledge Grabs . Floors A floor triangle is a triangle with normal.y > 0.01. Hitbox A floor's hitbox extends 78 units below and 100 units above the floor triangle. This allows Mario to move vertically along floors; if he is moving up or down a slope or stairs, he will be off the floor after his horizontal motion but still in its hitbox, which will snap him to the floor. He will always be snapped up if he's in a floor's hitbox below the floor, but he'll only be snapped down while above a floor if he is in a ground movement state. When walking on a slope, Mario will move horizontally at a rate slower than his actual speed, known as his  De Facto Speed . Any location that is not inside or above a floor hitbox is considered out of bounds; Mario will not be able to move into it of his own volition, and if forced into it, he will die. Ceilings A ceiling hitbox extends from 160 units below the ceiling to infinitely above. For ground and air movement, the ceiling will try its best to keep Mario out of it. If Mario walks into the ceiling, his quarter step will be canceled, and he will remain in place and do the pushing animation. If Mario is moving upwards in the air when coming in contact with the ceiling, his quarter step will be canceled and his vertical speed will be set to 0. On the contrary, when Mario falls onto a ceiling while airborne, his quarter step will be canceled and his horizontal speed will get set to 0, making him fall straight down. Although a ceiling will extend upwards infinitely, a floor can overwrite the ceiling hitbox, meaning that its hitbox will stop right when the floor hitbox starts. On the American release of the game, there is an interesting ceiling example found in  Rainbow Ride , where  the top of the chimney is not capped off , making the ceiling go up forever, softlocking Mario if he ends up sliding into it. Even though ceilings try to push Mario outwards, they can still be accessed using various techniques, such as getting pushed by an enemy. Note that once Mario is standing inside the ceiling, he is no longer able to move anywhere due to his quarter steps being cancelled.  For Water movement, Mario instead gets warped downward by ceilings. These downwarps are used in various TASes and speedruns. Surface Types While the surface type of a surface is not restricted to only floors, walls, or ceilings, in practice they are only used in certain scenarios, or wouldn't have any affect if such surface was of a different type, i.e. there could be a vertical wind ceiling or a death barrier wall, but those surfaces would have the behaviour.

[1]  The RTABC 70 Star world record without the round-to-zero glitch is also held by Marbler, with 2 A presses. The current RTABC 120 Star world record, achieved by BillyWAR1, finishes with a total of 216 A presses and with a time of 8 hours, 36 minutes, and 6 seconds. [2]  The current RTABC \"Max Stars 0xA\" world record, achieved by Marbler, finishes with a total of 49 stars and with a time of 4 hours, 28 minutes, and 14 seconds. The RTABC spreadsheet  contains leaderboards for individual stars, stages and full game categories; optimal routes for 70 Star, 120 Star, and Max Stars 0xA; conjectured improvements, and many other useful references. A Presses Left A  unique A press  refers to a single circumstance under which the A button must be pressed during a run. This circumstance may occur multiple times, leading to multiple A presses; if a workaround is found for the unique A press, all of those individual A presses may be saved. Currently, a theoretical 120 star run would take 58 A presses, a theoretical 70 star run would take 1 A press on N64 (1 in BitFS), 0 A presses on Wii VC, and 53 stars are possible without pressing A. Out of the 58 A presses left in the 120 star run, 39 of them (give or take) are unique. Below is a table listing all of them: A Press # Multiplicity Stage Purpose #1 1 BoB To shoot from the cannon #2 1 JRB To collect the chest star #3 1 JRB To ground pound the blue coin switch #4 2 BBH To get to the third floor #5 1 HMC To jump from the pole for reds #6 1 HMC To get to the Toxic Maze star #7 2 HMC To jump dive from dorrie's back #8 1 HMC To ground pound the blue coin switch #9 1 LLL To collect the elevator star #10 2 SSL To get out of the pyramid elevator (Tied with TAS) #11 1 DDD To jump off one of the back pole for 2 red coins and to clone poles #12 1 SL To shoot from the cannon #13 1 THI To double jump to a higher platform and collect red coins (Tied with TAS) #14 1 THI To dive to the upper platform and grab the high red coin (Tied with TAS) #15 1 TTC To jump up the cogs for bob-omb glide #16 3 TTC To double jump off the lower hand #17 3 TTC To wall kick to a higher platform #18 3 TTC To get off the elevator by the pole #19 1 TTC To jump past the moving bars #20 1 TTC To wall kick to the moving bars star #21 1 TTC To get on to the first rotating block #22 1 TTC To double jump off the second rotating block #23 1 TTC To triple jump off the platform above the rotating blocks #24 1 TTC To wall kick up to a higher platform #25 1 TTC To get on the whomp #26 1 RR To get on the ship #27 1 RR To get past the second wide blue block #28 1 RR To collect the Swingin' in the Breeze star #29 1 RR To jump on a fly guy and fall slower #30 1 RR To hyperjump onto the chuckya platform #31 1 PSS To collect the box star (Tied with TAS) #32 1 WMotR To shoot from the first cannon (Tied with TAS) #33 1 WMotR To shoot from the second cannon (Tied with TAS) #34 1 BitFS To get past the pole (Tied with TAS) #35 6 Castle To enter THI #36 6 Castle To enter TTC (Tied with TAS) #37 1 Castle To go to RR (Tied with TAS) #38 1 Castle To enter SA #39 1 Castle To go to WMotR (Tied with TAS) Some A presses require A to be held, but not pressed. These A presses are called Half A Presses and can come from a previous A press instead of a new one, so saving one wouldn't actually lower the A press count. The half a presses are listed below: Half A Press # Multiplicity Stage Purpose #1 1 DDD To outswim the whirlpool #2 2 DDD To swim with a shell for cloning (Tied with TAS) Possible A Press Saves Jolly Roger Bay It may be possible to get speed from the pillar and reactivate it some other place to ground pound the blue coin switch 0x for 100 coins, and would save A press #3. Ivan178 has shown that it is possible to get speed from the pillar to get Blast to the Stone Pillar 0x. [3] Dire Dire Docks Theoretically, you could collect the chests star using Hyperspeed punching, or the shell, to get enough speed to outrun the whirlpool, then preform frame perfect B swimming using frame counting (a method where you pause buffer, then use the sound of the pauses to determine how many frames have passed) to open all the chests and collect the star.

{"prompt": "Explain Whomp", "completion": "Whomp Technical Constants Object Group Surface Actor Group Group 14 Physical Constants Gravity -4 Buoyancy 2 Whomps are large enemies appearing in  Whomp's Fortress  and  Bowser in the Sky . They move along a predefined path until detecting  Mario  in a frontal radius. Upon detection, they will fall towards Mario and attempt to crush him. They can be defeated by ground-pounding on their back whilst laying horizontally. Behavior Whomp patrols a path with a length of 700 units in Whomp's Fortress and 200 units in Bowser in the Sky. Whomp walks forward with a forward speed of 3 units/frame until the distance from its home exceeds the length of its patrol path. When this occurs, Whomp stops, turns at 5.625 degrees/frame for 32 frames, and begins patrolling again. If Mario is within 45 degrees of Whomp's line of sight and within 1500 units of its location, Whomp accelerates to 9 units/frame to chase Mario. If Mario is then within 300 units of Whomp, Whomp stops and begins to jump with a y-velocity of Whomp's y-velocity is set to 40 units/frame. Then, Whomp's facing angle rotates at 1.40625 degrees/frame until its facing angle is 90 degrees. Once Whomp has hit the ground, it will stay in its grounded state for 100 frames if it did not squash Mario and 30 frames if it did squash Mario. If Whomp gets up, it rotates upward at 2.8125 degrees/frame until it is upright again and returns to patrolling its path.  While Whomp is down, if Mario stands on Whomp and then moves off, a coin is spawned. If Mario ground pounds on Whomp, 5 coins spawn, particles spawn, the screen shakes, a sound is played, and Whomp is deleted. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Objects Enemies Regular Amp  \u2022  Bob-omb  \u2022  Boo  \u2022  Bookend  \u2022  Bomp  \u2022  Bub   \u2022  Bubba  \u2022  Bullet Bill  \u2022  Bully  \u2022  Chain Chomp  \u2022  Chuckya  \u2022  Fly Guy  \u2022  Goomba  \u2022  Grindel  \u2022  Haunted Chair  \u2022  Heave-Ho  \u2022  Klepto  \u2022  Koopa  \u2022  Lakitu  \u2022  Mad Piano  \u2022  Moneybag  \u2022  Monty Mole  \u2022  Mr. Blizzard  \u2022  Mr. I  \u2022  Piranha Plant  \u2022  Fire Piranha Plant  \u2022  Pokey  \u2022  Scuttlebug  \u2022  Skeeter  \u2022  Snufit  \u2022  Spindel  \u2022  Spindrift  \u2022  Spiny  \u2022  Sushi  \u2022  Swoop  \u2022  Thwomp  \u2022  Tox Box  \u2022  Unagi  \u2022  Whomp Bosses King Bob-omb  \u2022   Big Boo  \u2022   Big Bully  \u2022  Bowser  \u2022  Eyerok  \u2022  Manta Ray  \u2022  Whomp King  \u2022  Wiggler NPCs Bob-omb Buddy  \u2022  Koopa the Quick  \u2022  Penguin  \u2022  Hoot  \u2022  MIPS  \u2022  Toad  \u2022  Ukiki  \u2022  Yoshi Other Objects Common Yellow Coin  \u2022  Blue Coin  \u2022  Red Coin  \u2022  1-Up Mushroom  \u2022  Bowling Ball  \u2022  Cannon  \u2022  Power Star  \u2022  Seesaw platforms  \u2022  Wing Cap  \u2022  Vanish Cap  \u2022  Metal Cap  \u2022  Elevator  \u2022  Sign  \u2022  Wooden post  \u2022  Cork Box  \u2022  Crazy Box  \u2022  Teleporter  \u2022  Warp Pipe  \u2022  Secret Level Specific Big Boo's Haunt tilting platform  \u2022  Merry-Go-Round  \u2022  Treadmill  \u2022  Pendulum  \u2022  Spinner  \u2022  Bowser Bomb  \u2022  Bowser key  \u2022  Grand Star  \u2022  Lethal Lava Land Drawbridge  \u2022  Tilted Inverted Pyramid Platform  \u2022  BitDW Trapdoor  \u2022  Controllable Platform  \u2022  Boulder Unused Boo key  \u2022  Bowser Anchor  \u2022  Fish spawner  \u2022  Trampoline  \u2022"}
{"prompt": "Explain Bub", "completion": "Bub Technical Constants Object Group General Actor Actor Group Group 13 Model ID 0x64 Hitbox Interaction Type Hurtbox Damage 1 Radius 20 Height 10 Down Offset 10 Code Initialization Behavior Script   [1] Behavior Code   [2] Bubs  are  Cheep-Cheep  like enemies appearing in  Dire, Dire Docks . There are 2 Bubs in Dire, Dire Docks, both located above the whirlpool in the first section. Bubs swim around slowly and do not home in on Mario, but they do deal damage. Contents 1   Behavior 1.1   Spawning 1.2   Actions 1.3   Vertical Movement 2   References Behavior Spawning Bub has 4 spawner functions, only one of which appears to do anything. First, the game stores a variable equal to an attribute for a value indicating the number of Bubs to spawn. If Mario is within 1500 units of the spawner, the game spawns as many Bubs as the stored value is equal to. Then, the game sets the spawner\u2019s action to 1. When the spawner\u2019s action is 1, the game checks if the difference between Mario and the spawner\u2019s Y-values are greater than 2000. If they are, the game sets the spawner\u2019s action to 2. Then the game sets the spawner\u2019s action to 3, and then sets the spawner\u2019s action to 0. Actions Bub has three different action functions. The 0th function sets Bub\u2019s first random variable attribute to a random number between 0 and 1 times 100, then sets Bub\u2019s second random variable attribute to a random number between 0 and 1 times 300, then sets Bub\u2019s action to 1. Action 1 checks if the object\u2019s timer is equal to 0. If it is, Bub\u2019s forward velocity is set to 2 plus a random number between 0 and 1 times 2 units/frame, and Bub\u2019s third random variable is set to a random number between 0 and 1. A variable initialized at the start of action 1 is set to Bub\u2019s Y-position minus Mario\u2019s Y-position. If the Bub\u2019s Y-position is less than the water level minus 50 units, the game can do one of two things. If the difference between Mario and Bub\u2019s Y-positions is negative, it is subtracted from 0 to make it positive. If the difference is less than 500 units, Bub\u2019s vertical function is called with a value of 1. Otherwise, Bub\u2019s vertical function is called with a value of 4. If Bub\u2019s Y-position is above the threshold, Bub\u2019s Y-Position is set equal to the threshold and if the distance between Mario\u2019s Y-position and Bub\u2019s Y-position is greater than 300, Bub\u2019s Y-position is lowered by 1 unit. If the lateral distance between Bub\u2019s home and Mario is greater than 800, Bub\u2019s angle toward Mario is set to its angle to its home. Bub rotates towards Mario at 1.4 degrees/frame. If Bub\u2019s distance from Mario is less than 200, and if Bub\u2019s third random variable attribute is less than .5, Bub\u2019s action is set to action 2. If Bub and Mario collide, Bub\u2019s action is set to action 2. In action 2, if Bub\u2019s timer is less than 20, and if Bub is interacted with, white particles are spawned. Otherwise, Bub\u2019s interaction status is reset to 0. If Bub\u2019s timer is equal to 0, a sound is played. If Bub\u2019s forward velocity is 0, Bub\u2019s forward velocity is changed to 6 units/frame. The game then computes the distance between Mario\u2019s Y-position and the object\u2019s Y-position, and runs the same loop as in action 1, with a few differences. If the difference between Mario and Bub\u2019s Y-positions is less than 500, Bub\u2019s vertical function is called with a value of 2 instead of 1, and instead of turning toward Mario at 1.4 degrees/frame, Bub turns toward an angle 180 degrees from Mario at 5.6 degrees/frame. When Bub\u2019s timer reaches 200 and Mario\u2019s distance from Bub is greater than 600, Bub returns to action 1.  Bub\u2019s behavior loop starts by finding the water level and storing a variable equal to the sum of Mario\u2019s Y-position and Bub\u2019s first random variable attribute. Bub\u2019s wall hitbox radius is set to 30 units and the game checks for any collisions. If the spawner is in action 2, Bub is deleted. Vertical Movement Bub\u2019s vertical movement is controlled by a special function which accepts an integer as its input. When the function is called, a variable is set storing the spawner\u2019s Y-position. If the difference of Bub\u2019s Y-position and this variable is greater than -100 and less than 1000 plus two times a random variable generated in Bub\u2019s actions, Bub\u2019s Y-position is incredented towards a new Y-position chosen through the sum of Bub\u2019s second random variable and Mario\u2019s position by the integer the function was called with every frame.

{"prompt": "Explain Overflow jump", "completion": "A diagram of Parallel Universe movement in  Hazy Maze Cave , after  Mario  has returned to the main map. A  Parallel Universe , or  PU , is a region of space located far outside the intended map boundaries that reflects certain aspects, especially the floors and/or ceilings, of the main map. When the game looks for floors below (or ceilings above) a given object, it first \"truncates\" the object's position from a floating point value to a 16-bit integer value. The range of a floating point value is much larger than the range of a 16-bit integer value (which is -2 15  = -32,768 to 2 15  - 1 = 32,767). If a coordinate of the object's position falls outside this range, it \"wraps around\". For example, if one of these floating point values is 40,000, then 40,000 - 65,536 = -25,536 will be used when determining if the object is aligned with a floor or ceiling. This gives the illusion that the floors and ceilings of the main level map are \"copied\" repeatedly in a uniform 3D grid, at a spacing of 65,536 units.   Frame of Peter Fedak's video where he turns Parallel Universes visible using hacks; notice the lack of  objects The truncation responsible for the existence of parallel universes is only performed when determining alignment with floors and ceilings. This means that walls and objects, both of which use floating point arithmetic to determine collision, do not \"exist\" in PUs, unless they are brought there. Due to the extremely high speed required to travel to PUs, they are not accessible from all courses. The courses where PUs can or cannot be accessed are summarized in the tables below. Work is ongoing to try to access PUs in courses such as  Bowser in the Fire Sea  (via  Bully battery ) and demo courses (via massive  Spawning displacement ). Methods to access a PU are: Speed: EBLJ HSW HSP BB Speed Conservation Displacement: Pole Teleport Platform Displacement Note that EBLJ (and other types of BLJs), and BB (Bully battery) cannot be achieved on Shindou versions. Also, if a method requires to set  HOLP  in a PU, then it is only possible to do it on VC (because other versions crash if a camera is in the PU, and by locking camera on the main map, the HOLP wont update, because camera being too far is one of the cases where HOLP doesn't update).

However, these behave completely differently to horizontal PUs. While truncated coordinates are used to  find  the floor below the object and the ceiling above the object, the original floating point values are used to determine what  effect  these surfaces have on the object. For example, when Mario is less than 160 units below the nearest ceiling, he is considered to be \"above\" the ceiling, his vertical speed is killed, and he bonks. If Mario moves to a positive (upward) vertical PU, the \"nearest\" ceiling will be determined based on truncated coordinates, and will therefore be in the main map. But when checking whether he is above this ceiling, floating point coordinates are used instead, and so Mario behaves as though he is stuck in a ceiling. This behavior results in positive vertical PUs appearing to be filled entirely with ceilings. [2] On the other hand, when Mario is below his \"nearest\" floor, he will snap up to it. This means that if Mario moves to a negative vertical PU, he will usually upwarp back to the main PU grid. This is called an  overflow jump , or  OJ  for short. It is typically difficult to get to a vertical PU. In the positive direction, there is a ceiling at  y  = 20,000 that prevents upward movement. We can bypass this ceiling by pressing against OoB, for example by using  hyperspeed flying . We can also use  platform displacement  or  indefinite owl flight  to reach a positive vertical PU. In the negative direction, we can use a  negative jump  to jump downward with large amounts of negative speed, or platform displacement. Travel and movement   Mario looking to the original map from a PU   Mario  BLJing  to a PU Parallel universes have found uses in both speed TASes and the  A Button Challenge  since they allow greater control of movement through a level. PU routing is comparable to movement through a five-dimensional space, as Mario can be modeled as traveling along five axes: three \"relative\" axes describing his position within the map, and two integers to specify which PU he is currently in. These PU axis integers are Mario's coordinates on the PU grid. Mario can adjust his  speed  and  angle  to move relatively around the stage regardless of how many PUs he moves in the  x  or  z  dimensions. Mario's movement is split up into four  quarter steps , and if any of these quarter steps attempts to place Mario out of bounds, his movement is canceled. Therefore in order to move to a PU, Mario's speed must be a multiple of four times the distance between PUs. If Mario takes all four quarter steps, then he will move four PUs in a single frame. This distance is called the  Quadruple Parallel Universe , or  QPU , distance. If one of Mario's quarter steps (other than the first one) ends out of bounds, the game will cut his movement short. In this case, Mario does not travel the full QPU distance, and instead ends at whichever PU he made it to before his intended quarter step became out of bounds. He is then \"QPU misaligned.\" As traveling to PUs involves moving very far from the origin, floating point imprecision can begin to have a significant effect on Mario's position, angle, and collision. When Mario's position becomes large enough, this imprecision will result in the coordinates in PUs becoming so coarse that Mario cannot cross from one coordinate to the next and, eventually, will result in certain PUs being completely unaccessible. Floating point truncation crash While in theory the grid of PUs extends indefinitely, the behavior of the truncation operation becomes \"undefined\" when the floating point value is outside the range -2 31  to 2 31  - 1. The Nintendo 64 and  iQue  Player [3]  versions of the game crash when such a truncation is attempted. The Wii and Wii U virtual console versions of the game do not crash, though it is not currently known whether they wrap around the 32-bit integer range, or cap to the endpoints of the range. Most emulators do not properly emulate the crash, except for a specific version of Mupen64, modded to crash correctly. While movement to PUs at coordinates this large is rarely useful, this crash can occur due to other instances of truncation in the game, even in PUs close to the main map. For example, when determining Mario's tilt while walking, the game multiples Mario's speed by 16,384 and then truncates this value. This means that the game can crash in certain conditions when Mario has a speed of about 131,000, which is below QPU speed. While not all conditions for these types of crashes are known, there are some that come up frequently. These are when: The camera enters a PU Mario bonks while in a PU Mario's quarter step gets canceled while on the ground Mario collides with a wall head-on with PU speed Miscellaneous behavior Certain objects and graphics behave interestingly while in parallel universes.

These coins have twice the coin value of a normal coin, and appear in groups of eight in every normal and hidden course in the vanilla game (excluding  Peach's Secret Slide ). When the eighth Red Coin is collected, a red coin star has a four-frame delay before it spawns at the  star marker . Note that spawning a  100 Coin Star  has no delay. Behavior When a red coin spawns, it checks for the nearest normal hidden red coin star and sets that to its parent if it exists. If none were found, it looks for the nearest Bowser hidden red coin star and sets that as its parent instead. If both of these checks fail, its parent is set to NULL. After setting its parent object, the object is given its hitbox. From here, the coin's only behavior is to respond interaction from Mario. If it is interacted, it will firstly increment it's parent coin count as long as its parent is not NULL. On the Japanese version, it will spawn a normal coin collection sound at this point. In both the US and JP version, it next spawns an  orange number  as long as the coin is not the eighth collected (More specifically, is not the coin which would normally trigger a star. It is possible to have more than eight coins in a hacked ROM). On the US version, it now instead spawns its sound, which increments its pitch for every red coin collected. The coin finishes by spawning coin sparkles and despawning. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Objects Enemies Regular Amp  \u2022  Bob-omb  \u2022  Boo  \u2022  Bookend  \u2022  Bomp  \u2022  Bub   \u2022  Bubba  \u2022  Bullet Bill  \u2022  Bully  \u2022  Chain Chomp  \u2022  Chuckya  \u2022  Fly Guy  \u2022  Goomba  \u2022  Grindel  \u2022  Haunted Chair  \u2022  Heave-Ho  \u2022  Klepto  \u2022  Koopa  \u2022  Lakitu  \u2022  Mad Piano  \u2022  Moneybag  \u2022  Monty Mole  \u2022  Mr. Blizzard  \u2022  Mr. I  \u2022  Piranha Plant  \u2022  Fire Piranha Plant  \u2022  Pokey  \u2022  Scuttlebug  \u2022  Skeeter  \u2022  Snufit  \u2022  Spindel  \u2022  Spindrift  \u2022  Spiny  \u2022  Sushi  \u2022  Swoop  \u2022  Thwomp  \u2022  Tox Box  \u2022  Unagi  \u2022  Whomp Bosses King Bob-omb  \u2022   Big Boo  \u2022   Big Bully  \u2022  Bowser  \u2022  Eyerok  \u2022  Manta Ray  \u2022  Whomp King  \u2022  Wiggler NPCs Bob-omb Buddy  \u2022  Koopa the Quick  \u2022  Penguin  \u2022  Hoot  \u2022  MIPS  \u2022  Toad  \u2022  Ukiki  \u2022  Yoshi Other Objects Common Yellow Coin  \u2022  Blue Coin  \u2022  Red Coin  \u2022  1-Up Mushroom  \u2022  Bowling Ball  \u2022  Cannon  \u2022  Power Star  \u2022  Seesaw platforms  \u2022  Wing Cap  \u2022  Vanish Cap  \u2022  Metal Cap  \u2022  Elevator  \u2022  Sign  \u2022  Wooden post  \u2022  Cork Box  \u2022  Crazy Box  \u2022  Teleporter  \u2022  Warp Pipe  \u2022  Secret Level Specific Big Boo's Haunt tilting platform  \u2022  Merry-Go-Round  \u2022  Treadmill  \u2022  Pendulum  \u2022  Spinner  \u2022  Bowser Bomb  \u2022  Bowser key  \u2022  Grand Star  \u2022  Lethal Lava Land Drawbridge  \u2022  Tilted Inverted Pyramid Platform  \u2022  BitDW Trapdoor  \u2022  Controllable Platform  \u2022  Boulder Unused Boo key  \u2022  Bowser Anchor  \u2022  Fish spawner  \u2022  Trampoline  \u2022"}

{"prompt": "Explain Glitchy Wall Kick", "completion": "  A GWK used in  1 Key   TAS   Several GWKs in quick succession in  WF A  glitchy wall kick , or  GWK  for short, is a wall kick where Mario wall kicks at an angle that normally wouldn't allow him to. Contents 1   Quarter Frame GWK 1.1   Cardinal corner GWKs 1.2   Eru's GWK constellation 2   Bonk GWK 2.1   Frame's GWK constellation 3   References Quarter Frame GWK A quarter frame GWK occurs when Mario is set to bonk on a wall other than the last wall he interacted with on that frame. If on any quarter frame Mario collides with a wall with an incident angle less than 45 degrees, he will be set to bonk (and therefore be able to wall kick) the next frame. However, the game doesn't keep track of which wall he bonked on. Instead, it keeps a reference to the last wall he interacted with on that frame, and so he will bonk on that wall, regardless of the incident angle. Therefore, a quarter frame GWK can be done by bonking on a wall during an earlier quarter frame, then touching the desired wall on the last quarter frame. This is most commonly done in a corner between two walls, where Mario interacts with the walls in a specific order, and can therefore bonk on the first wall in that order as he approaches the corner, and update his wall reference to the other wall once at the corner. [1] Instead of a wall with an incident angle less than 45\u00b0, Mario can also bonk on a ceiling, and then hit a wall later to wallkick. Cardinal corner GWKs In a concave cardinal corner, a GWK can be done using the unreferenced wall of a corner for the bonk, and the referenced wall for the wallkick angle. A good way to find which corners you can do this is to get mario to be able to run indefinitely into the corner. Whichever side he can run indefinitely into will be the side you can gwk on. After that you simply need to jump into the corner, coming from outside of the corner to the inside. If you pull too much into the corner, you won't bonk at all and will just be in the air as if you were running into the corner. if you pull too little, you will bonk on the wall like normal. At some sweet spot inbetween, you will get a bonk that turns mario around which obviously you can wallkick out of instead. [2] In a convex cardinal corner, Mario has to move from the 50 unit front wall push back to the side wall within just 3 quarterframes. Thus, convex cardinal corner GWKs require 66.67 speed, which can be obtained from speed sources such as slopes or several seconds of air time, but rarely through most grounded movement. Eru's GWK constellation In Tall Tall Mountain, there are two walls with an inside angle strictly between 90\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, allowing for an indefinite chain of quarter frame GWKs. [3] Eru's repeated gwk tech uses the fact that two walls that have a wider than 90\u00b0 angle can push Mario a little bit away from the wall that he bonks on, because both wall collisions are first detected and then applied additively. So by straining into both walls at once, Mario doesn't end up exactly in the corner but a little bit away from it, from where he can gwk again. [4] Bonk GWK A bonk GWK can occur when Mario bonks on a wall then bonks on a ceiling, another wall, or out-of-bounds within the 5 frames he can wall kick. This makes Mario wall kick away from the second wall in the direction of the first wall. [5]  Bonk GWKs can never be  firsties . Frame's GWK constellation In certain places where two non-cardinal walls project in the same cardinal direction, one wall can overhang over the other by at least 2 units perpendicularly, allowing for an indefinite chain of bonk GWKs. [6] If Mario hits the overhanging wall on one of his first 3 quarterframes, this lets him bonk to turn 180\u00b0 and face the inner wall another time. If the inner wall is cardinal, Mario cannot reach the overhanging wall twice in a row, as if he faces towards that wall once, he will face away from it the other time. This is because the combination of the 180\u00b0 turn from the bonk and the reflection on the wall will reflect Mario's facing yaw on a line perpendicular to the inner wall. If the outer wall is cardinal, there will be no overhang.

{"prompt": "Explain Triple Jump", "completion": "Triple Jump Properties Official Name ultraJump (Ultra Jump) Hex 0x01000882 Action Flags Air, Allow Vertical Wind Action Action Group Airborne ID 0x082 Transitions Out of Double Jump Land ,  Walking ,  Decelerating Other Animation 0xC1 A  triple jump  is typically the jump Mario performs after a  single jump  and a  double jump . Unlike the  single jump  and the  double jump , a triple jump's height does not depend on how long the A button has been held. It also always has the same vertical speed regardless of Mario's horizontal speed, and it also cannot grab ledges. Triple jumps are also able to have Mario fly with the wing cap. A triple jump can only be executed in when both these conditions are met: Mario is currently in the double jump landing action Mario has at least 20 horizontal positive speed When Mario has the wing cap on, the second condition doesn't have to be met. Contents 1   Transition In 2   Conditions for Action to Occur 3   Behavior 4   Special Triple Jump Transition In See  single jump  for more details Mario's vertical speed is set to 69. Mario's forward velocity is multiplied by 0.8 Conditions for Action to Occur There are two primary ways to enter this action. Depending on the action, here are the requirements: Double Jump Land : Pressing A Above a slope with Y-norm of 0.2923717 (sin(17)) or more. Is not about to slide. Is not about to enter first-person. Has not gone past the action timer. Is not wearing a  wing cap . Has more than 20 forward speed. Walking  &  Decelerating : The previous action is the double jump land action. Pressing A Is not about to slide. Is not about to enter first-person. Has quicksand depth less than 11. Is not squished. Has not run out the double jump timer. Is not wearing a  wing cap . Has more than 20 forward speed. Behavior Certain things here are more explained on their individual pages. If something lacks detail, check the link for more information. As with all airborne actions, a variety of \"cancels\" are checked prior to actually performing the triple jump action. These checks are as follows: Water - If Mario's height is lower than 100 units below the water height, the action is transitioned into the  water plunge  action. Squish - If Mario is supposed to be squished, his action is changed to the  squished  action. Vertical Wind- If Mario is above a vertical wind floor, his action is changed to the  vertical wind  action. (This is due to the triple jump action having the \"Allow Vertical Wind Action\" flag.) At this point, two more things happen prior to the triple jump action: Mario's quicksand depth is set to 0. Mario plays a falling noise if he has fallen more than 1150 units from his peak. With the triple jump action occurring, the following happens: If the \"special triple jump\" is unlocked, the action is instead set to the  special triple jump  action. This stops the triple jump action. If the B button is pressed, Mario will either enter the  dive  action. This stops the triple jump action. If the Z button is pressed, Mario will enter the  ground pound  action. This stops the triple jump action. Mario performs the other noises for the jump, depending on the version of the game. Now, Mario performs the quarter-frame movement via a full  common air step . The landing action is a  triple jump land  action and the check has neither the \"Check Ledge Grab\" and \"Check Hang\" flags, preventing it from doing so. The flip noises are now played for the jump. Special Triple Jump Main article:  Special Triple Jump After talking to Yoshi on the castle's rooftop, Mario gets a special triple jump. The jump causes Mario to roll and  be surrounded by sparkles. Both normal and special triple jumps are executed in the same way and has the same max height. Their height are not affected by speed. A special triple jump has a bounce at the end of the jump, which has an initial VS of 40. The bounce stores VS. Mario cannot wallkick from a special triple jump, but instead Mario bounces of the wall, converting positive speed to negative speed and the other way around. It also has a controllable jump height. Mario doesn't take fall damage when landing from it as well. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Actions Uninitialized Stationary Actions Idle  \u2022  Start Sleeping  \u2022  Sleeping

The star is located on  Unagi 's tail, and can be collected by luring him outside his hole. This star only appears in the 2nd mission. Contents 1   TAS 1.1   TAS Strategy 1.2   TAS History 2   References TAS TAS Strategy Mario heads to the  Metal Cap  box, then does a long jump which breaks it, and does a wall kick dive to collect the metal cap while moving in the opposite direction. Once he recovers, he quickly turns and does a  BLJ  below the rock. He does 8 long jumps under the rock plus 2 extra  pause-buffered  long jumps on the beach slope. Once he reaches the wall, his next intended position becomes out of bounds, so Mario stays still. He rotates to move his next position back in bounds and moves along the edge of the wall into the water. The last frame on land is in the rock next to the water. This allows for Mario to move the maximum distance before entering the water, which quarters his speed. On the 2nd frame in the water, Mario  snaps to the surface . As he moves, he rotates so that he weaves between the pillars, landing on the back of the middle pillar. This snaps Mario onto the slope, causing it to reduce Mario's speed, hence making him move down the edge of the deep area. Halfway down Mario falls off the floor. He moves across the course to a steep surface above the eel. This makes it move out. Mario jumps and collects the star when it appears. TAS History Can the Eel Come out to Play?

It consists of a room fully filled with water; it contains 40  yellow coins  that can be used to refresh Mario's air. There are also 8  red coins  that must be collected to spawn a star. It is the only stage to have an (albeit implicit) time limit, as you cannot resurface and there are a limited amount of coins you can use to refresh your air. Contents 1   A Presses 2   Other Challenges 3   Coins 4   References A Presses Although the stage itself does not require any A presses, as it can easily be done by swimming with the B button, entering the aquarium is a challenge on its own. The current strategy used is very complicated. Because the final  text redirection  is done using a door that requires 1 star, the whole strat has to be done without collecting a single star. We have to enter  Bowser in the Dark World , get the basement key, and go to  Shifting Sand Land . Once in there, the TAS creates a setup using various objects found in the course to make sure Mario gets the right angle and speed for the lobby movement. [1] Other Challenges This star cannot be collected in the  Coinless Challenge ,  CCC Challenge ,  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , or  UBER Challenge , as it requires collecting red coins and swimming. This star can be collected in the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge ,  Pacifist Challenge ,  B Button Challenge ,  Z Button Challenge , and  Floor is Lava Challenge .

In order to complete it, Mario must enter the toxic maze and find his way to a hole in the wall where he goes up an elevator and has to climb across a hangable ceiling to the star platform. Speedrun Strategy A fast way to complete this level is to enter the room where the rocks fall into the hole, and double jump then wall kick to end up onto the platform with the box. Then from there Mario can long jump onto the star platform skipping the maze entirely. A faster method involves entering the same room, and triple jumping off the platform with the heart on it, and wall kicking onto the star plaform. A Button Challenge The star can be collected in 0 A presses. This is done by raising a scuttlebug in the room where the star is located. Then Mario enters the maze, and uses the bounces from a monty mole and a swooper to get to the door. Once Mario goes up the elevator, he uses a bounce from the scuttlebug which was raised earlier to reach the star.

By touching any of the  crystal taps  in the course, the water level is raised or lowered to the height of the tap used. Additionally, Mario's height as he enters the painting determines the water level immediately after entering the course (low, medium, or high). The course has a tunnel with a loading zone to take Mario back and forth between the main area and \"downtown\".

Although this means only the lowest water level can be accessed from the start of the level. Shocking Arrow Lifts!  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/GpLDcOdhchY There is a warp nearby that takes you directly above the star. Top o' The Town  (0x) Video 1 (Chuckya):  https://youtu.be/vc_xUKnw7Z8   Video 2 (VSC):  https://youtu.be/Z25qV3sGIn0   This star is particularly difficult because while you can break the box without pressing  A , the star itself was 1 unit too high for a dive recover to work. It was originally solved when Plush figured out you could hold  Chuckya  as a light object on the bridge. Now, there are 6 different strategies, using Chuckya, VSC, a skeeter clone, a fire clone, a teleporter clone, and a heave-ho. Among these, the VSC strategy is the fastest one. Secrets in the Shallows & Sky  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/9Zc7wORb1FE   The strategy to get this star was to use a heave-ho to get one secret and chuckya to get on the bridge to get to another secret. the other secrets are fairly easy to get by falling from above. Express Elevator - Hurry Up!  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/gxkGeNAdsWg   The problem with this star is that it was originally not possible to get onto the elevator without pressing  A . Eventually, Pannen realized that by raising the water level, he could get on the elevator with half an A press with barely enough time to get on. After that, it was found to be possible without pressing  A  by using negative VSC which gave some time to get on to the elevator without pressing the  A  button. Go to Town for Red Coins  (0x) Video 1 (Water Level Raising):  https://youtu.be/cdM-h1Ge9xk   Video 2 (Faster Strategy):  https://youtu.be/25G6qXpXwHw   Originally, this star was saved because the water in the town bobs up and down by 20 units. If you go through the loading zone in the middle of the tunnel, the water level from the town will be saved and when you come back, the water level will be at the last position it was at. However, when you come back, the water level saved is now used as the median. So, by waiting for the water level to bob up or down by 20 units, unloading and then reloading the town, and repeating this process, you can raise or lower the water level. Later, it was figured out by Iwer Sonsch that one of the red coins could be collected without breaking its box, putting a skeeter on the grey building, and using chuckya to give him some speed where he could use frame perfect B swimming to conserve that speed underwater to swim faster. Iwer then figured out you could clone one of the boxes to save some time, and put a skeeter on the brown building which saved a trip to the town. Pannen also found out that you could conserve more speed after throwing the box clone which helped him swim a lot faster and saved another trip to the town. Quick Race through Downtown!  (0x) Video 1 (Water Level Overflow):  https://youtu.be/2NtxoAgNY80   Video 2 (Cloning):  https://youtu.be/7jqrAohBTxg   Originally, Pannenenkoek2012 was able to do this in a single  A  press by bringing Chuckya to the loading zone and then cloning the star. The strategy used one  A  press to start swimming after grabbing chuckya. In May of 2014, he figured out that by using the water level raising glitch that had been used before, he was able to raise the water level so much that he could overflow the water level, making the water level alternate from being completely full to completely dry. The water level is stored as a 16-bit signed integer which means the only possible values it can be are between -32,768 to 32,767. If the water level goes over 32,767, it will wrap back around to -32,768 and vice versa. In October of 2021, it was figured out that you could actually clone the star without having to press  A  again to swim with chuckya. By having chuckya come over to the loading zone, it was possible for Mario to grab chuckya and rapidly go through the loading zone to clone the star. WDW 100 Coins  (0x) https://youtu.be/WU_6RKfsHE4   This star isn't very problematic as there are enough coins in the main room to get the 100 coin star. However, chuckya was required to get Mario onto the bridge which lets him get a box with 10 coins in it. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge , where  Quick Race Through Downtown!  can either be cloned, or Mario can clip into the cage with a BLJ. In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , only  Shocking Arrow Lifts!  can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , only  Top o' the Town  can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. The JP 1.0 version requires triple jumping into the pipe to avoid opening the cannon. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Shocking Arrow Lifts! ,  Top o' the Town ,  Express Elevator--Hurry Up! , and  Quick Race Through Downtown!  can be collected. The latter two require  Hyperspeed Wall Kicking  and  BLJs  to clip through walls. In the  Floor is Lava Challenge ,  Shocking Arrow Lifts! ,  Top o' the Town ,  Express Elevator--Hurry Up! , and  Quick Race Through Downtown!  can be collected, as Mario starts the course on a wooden board object. and can swim around the course.

{"prompt": "Explain Loading zone", "completion": "An  instant warp  is a special  floor  that, when passed above, causes Mario to instantly move or change areas without interrupting normal gameplay. In the case of  loading zones , Mario enters a different area in the level and a different set of objects loads. In the case of the  endless staircase , Mario instantly changes position but not area. Because normal gameplay is not interrupted when triggering an instant warp, interesting side effects can occur. When an instant warp displaces Mario, it moves the camera as well to maintain its position relative to Mario. If the camera is locked and Mario gets displaced a large distance, the camera can enter a PU, causing the Nintendo 64 versions of the game to crash. This is possible by repeatedly displacing Mario using the endless staircase [1]  or the TTM slide [2] . If the warp displaces Mario out of bounds, then the  OoB failsafe  mechanism triggers, effectively canceling the displacement [3] .

It displaces Mario by 8192 in the x direction. Shifting Sand Land : There is a two-way loading zone inside the pyramid in the entrance to the  Eyerok  boss fight. Tall, Tall Mountain : There are two one-way loading zones along the slide. These displace Mario by (10240, 7168, 10240) and (-11264, 13312, 3072). They are located inside tunnels, which prevent Mario from activating them from above. Wet Dry World : There is a two-way loading zone in the tunnel leading to the town. Glitches Cloning When passing through a loading zone, all objects unload in order to make room for the objects in the new area. If Mario is holding an object when he passes through a loading zone, he will be holding either a vacant object slot or an object from the new area. New Area Not Loading If Mario gets past a loading zone without activating it (either by passing it with hyperspeed or clipping behind it in some other way), then the new area does not load and the old one does not unload.

Keep in mind that if there are any blue stars (uncollected) present in the star selection menu, then the last version that can be selected is the first blue star and not the stars after it: Act 1 : This is the default act until Star 1 is completed. The manta ray is not present. Act 2 : Accessed by selecting Star 2 through Star 6, but only after collecting  Board Bowser's Sub . The manta ray will appear. Additionally, Bowser's submarine will disappear after Bowser in the Fire Sea is completed, replaced by several moving poles across the ceiling of the course. Tips You need to do 100 before completing  Bowser in the Fire Sea  since the sub is used to grab the red coins in RTA.  You cannot star select to re-spawn the sub. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e RTA Guide Platforms Nintendo 64  \u2022  Virtual Console  \u2022  Emulator Categories 0/1 Star  \u2022  16 Star  \u2022  70 Star  \u2022  120 Star  \u2022  31 Star  \u2022  50 Star  \u2022  All\u00a0!

Other Challenges This star cannot be collected in the  Coinless Challenge ,  Capless/Cannonless Challenge ,  CCC Challenge ,  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , and  UBER Challenge . It is the only star in the game that cannot be collected capless, although it is possible to collect it cannonless either by building up enough speed to fly to the highest cloud or by using the Wing Cap infinite height glitch. This star can be collected in the  Pacifist Challenge ,  B Button Challenge , and  Z Button Challenge . In the B Button Challenge, the Wing Cap infinite height glitch is required to reach the highest cloud on the JP 1.0 version to avoid opening the cannon.

Behavior The haunted chair behavior actually accounts for two different kinds objects: The chair in front of the Mad Piano, and the other haunted chairs. The two cases are distinguished by the distance from the chair to an object using the Mad Piano behavior. The first case occurs if there exists an object with the mad piano behavior and that object is within 300 units of the chair. Then, the Mad Piano is set as the chair\u2019s parent object. When the lateral distance between the chair and Mad Piano is less than 250 units, the chair will begin to fall. The chair can fall in one of four directions separated by 90-degree angles, with the direction being dependent on the angle from the Mad Piano to the chair. In three cases, the chair will fall being rotated 90-degrees, but if Mad Piano approaches behind the chair, the final angle will be 112.5-degrees. The chair falls by rotated toward its final angle at a rate of 8.24 degrees/frame. Thus, the full rotation will take either 11 or 14 frames.

{"prompt": "Explain Nintendo 64", "completion": "A Nintendo 64 console with a gray controller attached. See this page on Wikipedia The  Nintendo 64  or  N64  is a Nintendo console released in 1996. It was one of the first game consoles to feature a joystick and 3D capabilities.  Super Mario 64  was the system's primary launch title. Hardware The N64 contains the following main components: - A VR4300 (R4300i) MIPS III CPU clocked at 93.75 MHz by default - The Reality Coprocessor (RCP), which handles graphics and audio and is made up of the Reality Display Processor (RDP) and Reality Signal Processor (RSP), the latter of which is an R4000-based vector processor - 4.5 MB of RDRAM (9 MB with Expansion Pak); the RAM is on a 9-bit bus but the 9th bit is only available to the RCP, making it only 4 MB (8 MB with Expansion Pak) for the CPU - The Peripheral Interface chip (PIF), which verifies cartridges and interfaces the CPU with peripherals such as  controllers , cartridge  EEPROMs , and the reset button Boot Process This article is a  stub . As such, it is not complete. You can help Ukikipedia by  expanding it . On boot, the PIF verifies the cartridge and then hands control over to the CPU which runs the PIF ROM mapped at 0x1FC00000 in memory. The PIF ROM (I think?) loads the first megabyte of the cartridge ROM data (not including the header) into RAM at the entry point. Resetting This article is a  stub . As such, it is not complete. You can help Ukikipedia by  expanding it . When the reset button is pressed, the PIF sends a \"pre-NMI\" interrupt to the CPU, and 0.5s later sends the NMI that resets the console. Letting the CPU know about the reset in advance allows games to add handlers for resets, such as SM64's reset animation. When the NMI occurs, RAM is not cleared. In SM64, the bss of the main segment is cleared to 0 on boot, but not the bss of other segments (I think?)."}
{"prompt": "Explain Chill Bully", "completion": "Bully [1] [2] Bully Chill Bully Hitbox Info Hitbox Damage 0 Damage without hat 0 Speed to add Tangibility radius 1000 Interaction type Bully Interaction Found In Lethal Lava Land, Bowser in the Fire Sea, Snowman's Land Bullies  are uncommon enemies in  Super Mario 64 , appearing in Lethal Lava Land, Bowser in the Fire Sea, and Snowman's Land. Bullies attack by running in to Mario, knocking him back. They can be defeated by knocking them into lava. The regular Bully model is loaded in actor group 2, while the Chill Bully model is loaded in with actor group 16. Contents 1   Locations 2   Use in Challenges 3   Bully Crashes 3.1   Angle Conversion Crash 3.2   Divide by 0 Crash 4   References Locations The following courses have Bullies: Lethal Lava Land Bowser in the Fire Sea Snowman's Land Use in Challenges An application of the  Bully Battery  glitch has been used to complete  Elevator Tour in the Volcano  in 0 A-presses and has been suggested as a possible method for getting past the Bowser in the Fire Sea pole in 0 A-presses on N64. Bullies have also seen minor use in other challenges, such as doing Bowser in the Fire Sea with no joystick. Bully Crashes Angle Conversion Crash Normally, a Bully's angle is confined to the range [-32768, 32767]. However, this code does not occur if the Bully is out-of-bounds. Due to this oversight, if Mario knocks a Bully out-of-bounds, its angle will increase by 32767 every frame without bound. After approximately 36 minutes, the Bully's angle exceeds the hex value 0x7FFFFFFF (2,147,483,647) at which point the game will crash from trying to perform a double-to-int conversion on a value above 0x7FFFFFFF. This crash does not occur on emulators, except for Wii VC, where the bully will keep moving on one axis, all the way out of the map.  Divide by 0 Crash The Bully enemy's knockback logic contains a step that involves dividing by the horizontal distance between Mario and the Bully. Thus, the game will crash from a divide by 0 error if the operation is performed while the distance between Mario and the Bully is 0. Causing this crash requires very specific conditions. Mario must be next to an area out-of-bounds so that he will not be moved away from the bully before the crash can occur and Mario must be in a state to receive knockback from the bully, making the exact movement needed to cause the crash very precise.

If Mario touches one, he is granted a  life . Contents 1   Behavior 1.1   Stationary 1-Ups 1.2   Pole 1-Ups 1.3   Slide 1-Ups 1.4   Hidden Trigger 1-Ups 1.5   Spawned 1-Ups 1.6   Fleeing Box 1-Ups 2   The Impossible 1-up 3   References Behavior There are 6 different types of 1-Up Mushrooms. All 1-Up types share certain properties. When a 1-Up collides with Mario, an extra life sound plays, Mario gains an extra life, an the 1-Up deactivates. Additionally, all 1-Ups share the same gravity, friction and buoyancy parameters on spawn. However, the 6 types each have unique behaviors. Stationary 1-Ups Stationary 1-Ups, as their name implies, are stationary and do not move at all. They become visible when Mario is within 3000 units of their position, and, like all 1-Ups, will deactivate if collected by Mario. They do not despawn on their own. Pole 1-Ups Pole 1-Ups are triggered by climbing up to the top of a pole. They start off as invisible and intangible. When the 1-Up is triggered, the 1-Up is made visible and begins moving upward at 40 units/frame. After 17 frames, the 1-Up starts a loop in the air. 20 frames later, the 1-Up becomes tangible and begins following Mario at 10 units/frame. Slide 1-Ups Slide 1-Ups are those that appear on slides. When Mario gets within 1000 units of the 1-Up, it will begin to slide away from him. While on the ground, sliding 1-Ups will accelerate by 25 units/frame per frame, up to a maximum velocity of 40 units/frame. In the air, sliding 1-Ups decelerate by 2% every frame. If Mario is more than 5000 units away from the sliding 1-Up, it will flicker and disappear after 40 frames. Hidden Trigger 1-Ups Hidden 1-Ups are activated by touching all triggers associated with that 1-Up. They most commonly require 4 triggers to spawn, but can require as few a 1 trigger. When all triggers are activated, the 1-Up becomes visible, circles in the air with the same parameters as the Pole 1-Up, and then become tangible. The 1-Up will move in a direction 180 degrees from Mario, and if it collides with a wall or Mario moves more than 3000 units away from the 1-Up, the 1-Up will begin to flicker and disappear. Spawned 1-Ups Spawned 1-Ups are 1-Ups spawned by breaking a box with a 1-Up, by killing 8 Monty Moles, or by attacking a butterfly triplet. After spawning they will execute a loop, become tangible, and move in a straight line on the ground at 2 units/frame. After 300 frames (10 seconds), the 1-Up will disappear. While the 1-Up is programmed to flicker before disappearing, it does not as the flickering function is overridden by another function that makes the 1-Up visible as long as Mario is within 3000 units of it. Fleeing Box 1-Ups Fleeing box 1-Ups are 1-Ups spawned from boxes that move away from Mario. They behave the same as other spawned 1-Ups, except that actively move away from Mario and only disappear if Mario moves more than 3000 units away from them or they hit a wall. Like the other spawned 1-Ups, they do not flicker due to their flickering being overridden by another function. The Impossible 1-up The Impossible 1-up Mushroom is a 1-up in the  CCM  slide, in the secret tunnel. It was originally named this way because it goes through a wall before Mario can normally reach it [1] .  This 1-up was first collected by toyuru2 in 2013 [2] , but they had to die to get it.  In 2023, AlexPalix1 managed to collect it for the first time without dying using a combination of hyperspeed wallkicking and a Pedro spot [3] References \u2191   \"Alternative Camera Angles\" by UncommentatedPannen \u2191   \"CCM 1upmushroom (slider)\" by toyuru2 \u2191   \"[TAS] SM64 - CCM 2nd Slide 1up Without Dying\" by PaLiX_ v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Objects Enemies Regular Amp  \u2022  Bob-omb  \u2022  Boo  \u2022  Bookend  \u2022  Bomp  \u2022  Bub   \u2022  Bubba  \u2022  Bullet Bill  \u2022  Bully  \u2022  Chain Chomp  \u2022  Chuckya  \u2022  Fly Guy  \u2022  Goomba  \u2022  Grindel  \u2022  Haunted Chair  \u2022  Heave-Ho  \u2022  Klepto  \u2022  Koopa  \u2022  Lakitu  \u2022  Mad Piano  \u2022  Moneybag  \u2022  Monty Mole  \u2022  Mr. Blizzard  \u2022  Mr. I  \u2022  Piranha Plant  \u2022  Fire Piranha Plant  \u2022  Pokey  \u2022  Scuttlebug  \u2022  Skeeter  \u2022  Snufit  \u2022  Spindel  \u2022  Spindrift  \u2022  Spiny  \u2022  Sushi  \u2022  Swoop  \u2022  Thwomp  \u2022  Tox Box  \u2022  Unagi  \u2022  Whomp Bosses King Bob-omb  \u2022   Big Boo  \u2022   Big Bully  \u2022  Bowser  \u2022  Eyerok  \u2022  Manta Ray  \u2022  Whomp King  \u2022  Wiggler NPCs Bob-omb Buddy  \u2022  Koopa the Quick  \u2022  Penguin  \u2022  Hoot  \u2022  MIPS  \u2022  Toad  \u2022  Ukiki  \u2022  Yoshi Other Objects Common Yellow Coin  \u2022  Blue Coin  \u2022  Red Coin  \u2022  1-Up Mushroom  \u2022  Bowling Ball  \u2022  Cannon  \u2022  Power Star  \u2022  Seesaw platforms  \u2022  Wing Cap  \u2022  Vanish Cap  \u2022  Metal Cap  \u2022  Elevator  \u2022  Sign  \u2022  Wooden post  \u2022  Cork Box  \u2022  Crazy Box  \u2022  Teleporter  \u2022  Warp Pipe  \u2022  Secret Level Specific Big Boo's Haunt tilting platform  \u2022  Merry-Go-Round  \u2022  Treadmill  \u2022  Pendulum  \u2022  Spinner  \u2022  Bowser Bomb  \u2022  Bowser key  \u2022  Grand Star  \u2022  Lethal Lava Land Drawbridge  \u2022  Tilted Inverted Pyramid Platform  \u2022  BitDW Trapdoor  \u2022  Controllable Platform  \u2022  Boulder Unused Boo key  \u2022  Bowser Anchor  \u2022  Fish spawner  \u2022  Trampoline  \u2022"}

{"prompt": "Explain Hurtbox", "completion": "Hitbox of a  Power Star This article is a  stub . As such, it is not complete. You can help Ukikipedia by  expanding it . A  hitbox  is an invisible shape commonly used in video games for real-time collision detection. It is often a rectangle or circle (in 2D games) or cuboid, cylinder, or sphere (in 3D) that is attached to and follows a point on an  object . They are used for collision detection. Contents 1   Hurtboxes 1.1   List 1.2   Uses 2   Collision hitboxes 3   Clone hitboxes 3.1   Overshadowing Hurtboxes If you typed  Hurtbox , you may be looking for the  interaction type  called  Hurtbox 1  or  Hurtbox 2 . Hurtboxes  are a specific type of hitbox that hurt Mario when he touches them. Many different enemies in the game have hurtboxes. List Goombas Explosions  (spawned by  Bob-ombs  and  Mines ) Bowser Bubble Bombs Fire Clams Chests And many more. Note that  lava  is a  floor  with a special property, not a hurtbox. Uses Because hurtboxes provide an easy way to damage Mario, they create an easy way to utilize  Pause Buffered Hitstun . The hurtbox of fire also gives a small vertical boost, which is useful in the  A Button Challenge . Collision hitboxes Many hitboxes push Mario away, such as those of Bob-ombs and  Chuckyas . These are necessary for  Quick Release  and are also the basis for the  Bloated Bob-omb  and  Handsfree Teleported Bob-omb  glitches, which work because the Bob-omb's size is large enough that its hitbox pushes Mario back, but it moves with him because he's holding it. Clone hitboxes Cloned objects that Mario can pick up normally act normal when set down, and have normal hitboxes. However, clones of objects never meant to be held have odd hitboxes. The majority of them can be interacted with only once by Mario, if at all. Platforms are intangible, and most enemies can injure Mario once and then become intangible. Coins can only be collected once, but don't disappear.  Shells  and  Bullies  are exceptions to this rule, as they can be interacted with multiple times. Overshadowing Clone hitboxes overshadow the hitboxes of other clones of the same type. For example, Mario can release a  fire  clone and will immediately get burned by it. Then, he can stand in its (now dormant) hitbox to release another without getting burned. This serves many purposes in the  A Button Challenge , including  Bowser in the Sky  and  Tick Tock Clock ."}

Version 2 : Accessed by selecting Stars 2 through 6. The staircase is present, and Boos will be present at the merry-go-round. Coins Big Boo's Haunt's coin total is 151. Of this number, 105 come from the 21  Blue Coins  in the course, the most out of any course. Big Boo's Haunt does not have any known  Infinite Coin Glitches , so its  coin limit  is 151.

Note that previously, it was believed that the only way to go to the second floor (in 0x A) is by selecting version 1, and use  VSC  while the stairs are raising [1] . However, now it is discovered that it is actualy possible to climb the last step with the stars already raised [2]  by using negative VSC to fall precisely so that a quarterframe is in the right location to preform a  glitchy ledge grab  (other steps can simply be reached by using a misalignment).

Go On a Ghost Hunt  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/YjY5K65Yi44 Mario needs to defeat all boos on the first floor and defeat Big Boo to collect the star at the entrance to the second floor accessed by a rising staircase. The star is 281 units above the floor  [3] , barely reachable by dive-recovering. Ride Big Boo's Merry-Go-Round  (0x) Main article:  Ride Big Boo's Merry-Go-Round Video:  https://youtu.be/x-Ry122OOuA Version 2  must be used for boos to show up in the merry-go-round. The biggest obstacle is finding a way to reach the star since it is 357 units above the floor [4] . After many ideas trying to go out of bounds to utilize VSC failed, Pannenkoek eventually found a method to use a scuttlebug's bounce to reach the star.  To execute this strategy, Mario first needs to lure a scuttlebug outside the mansion to a specific location via  Scuttlebug transportation , and then  raise  it. On the old, slower strat, Scuttlebug is being raised for many hours (3 hours or 10 hours depending on which method is used [5] ). This will place a scuttlebug in a vertical  PU  (VPU 1). Then, Mario will go outside to perform a specific maneuver to lure the scuttlebug to the specified location as it is falling through floors and ceilings, ending up above a floor in the merry-go-round by snapping it to a wall nearby via  scuttlebug wall snapping . The movement is very precise as to not prematurely let it interact with the wrong wall in the VPU and snap into the wrong location. Once the scuttlebug is in place, Mario enters the merry-go-round room, beating up boos and proceeding the level as normal, and finishes up by bouncing on the scuttlebug to reach the star. On the new, faster strat, after setting the HOLP, Scuttlebug is raised for only 2 minutes, until it reaches the shed's roof. Then, a hat in hand glitch is preformed, and Mario grabs the crazy box. On the last bounce, the bouncing is interrupted by hitting a raised scuttlebug, which drops the crazy box (on the HOLP laterally, but at Mario's heihgt). After beating up the Boos, Mario reactivates the crazy box and grabs it before it falls on the floor and disappears. The crazy box is used to reach the star. Secret of the Haunted Books  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/rrSdI57l2O4 The bookshelf puzzle is solved by pushing the three books in a high-low-middle order, the highest one being fortunately reachable by dive-recovering. After revealing the other side and go through the door, the star can be reached by sliding on the rails and then ground-pound midair to gain enough height to collect the star. Seek the 8 Red Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/yBvptqoQ6w4   Four coins are located on the first floor, two of which locating on top of the bookshelf which requires careful manipulations of two boos and a flying book to bounce on them. Afterwards, Mario picks up the remaining four coins on the second floor to spawn the star and then collects it. Big Boo's Balcony  (0x) Main article:  Big Boo's Balcony Video:  https://youtu.be/CLksdecIacA The star is located on the roof, which can be accessed from the third floor of the mansion. The biggest obstacle is going to the third floor of the mansion without pressing A. Under normal conditions, the crazy box does not go high enough to reach the roof (to meet Big Boo), and jumping from the second floor to the third floor requires an A press. Therefore, the solution is to transport and raise the scuttlebugs and place them inside the mansion. Pannenkoek raises three scuttlebugs for 13 hours to place them in Vertical PU (VPU 2) in order to have enough time to perform the maneuver outside to induce a lunge, moving them into the mansion and snapping them onto the library on the second floor. Then, Pannenkoek raises them for another 8 minutes to isolate their heights so that Mario can bounce on them. The raising of the scuttlebugs is all done before Mario even begins beating the boos to access the second floor (via VSC). Afterwards, Mario enters the roof and goes up the slopes to go on top of the item block. Finally, he defeats the Big Boo by performing many breakdances and collects the star.  The faster strat uses star dance clip, as it allows raising scuttlebug while staying in only one room.  Eye to Eye in the Secret Room  (0x) Main article:  Big Boo's Balcony Video:  https://youtu.be/80-X66pVv5k The same maneuver is performed so as to reach the third floor, except it is even more difficult. The secret room, where the star is located, is only accessible by putting on a vanish cap, and therefore Mario has a strict time limit to reach the third floor without the cap running out. The only route fast enough for this is to navigate from the second floor to the third floor, instead of taking the detour outside the mansion to reach the roof [6] . Therefore, Mario begins placing the scuttlebugs into vertical PUs. He manipulates them in the same location as used in  Big Boo's Balcony  (13 hours are spent in this phase), and then he navigates up the mansion with VSC and scuttlebug bouncing while picking up a vanish cap during the process. He rushes into the secret room in time, defeats Mr. I swiftly, and finally collects the star. The faster strat uses faster Scuttlebug raising, which makes Scuttlebugs preserving lunging speed while turning towards their home. BBH 100 Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/ApIxdRirfOk   There are fortunately enough coins to collect on the first floor and basement of Big Boo's Haunt.  Version 2  is used here, using the coins from Boos and Mr. I as primary sources. The version later than Star 2 is used as otherwise the merry-go-round would not have boos flying out. The red coins on the bookshelf are the trickiest ones the collect since Boos and flying books need to be manipulated. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge , with  Eye to Eye in the Secret Room  requiring  Hyperspeed Wall Jumps  to clip into the room. In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected, as they all require entering doors. In the  Pacifist Challenge ,  Secret of the Haunted Books  and  Seek the 8 Red Coins  can be collected in isolation. However, they cannot be collected in a full-game run because Big Boo's Haunt requires killing a Boo to enter. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Secret of the Haunted Books  can be collected in isolation. However, Big Boo's Haunt cannot be entered at all in a full-game run, because it requires killing a Boo to enter. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to get more coins than intended.

{"prompt": "Explain Hitboxes", "completion": "Hitbox of a  Power Star This article is a  stub . As such, it is not complete. You can help Ukikipedia by  expanding it . A  hitbox  is an invisible shape commonly used in video games for real-time collision detection. It is often a rectangle or circle (in 2D games) or cuboid, cylinder, or sphere (in 3D) that is attached to and follows a point on an  object . They are used for collision detection. Contents 1   Hurtboxes 1.1   List 1.2   Uses 2   Collision hitboxes 3   Clone hitboxes 3.1   Overshadowing Hurtboxes If you typed  Hurtbox , you may be looking for the  interaction type  called  Hurtbox 1  or  Hurtbox 2 . Hurtboxes  are a specific type of hitbox that hurt Mario when he touches them. Many different enemies in the game have hurtboxes. List Goombas Explosions  (spawned by  Bob-ombs  and  Mines ) Bowser Bubble Bombs Fire Clams Chests And many more. Note that  lava  is a  floor  with a special property, not a hurtbox. Uses Because hurtboxes provide an easy way to damage Mario, they create an easy way to utilize  Pause Buffered Hitstun . The hurtbox of fire also gives a small vertical boost, which is useful in the  A Button Challenge . Collision hitboxes Many hitboxes push Mario away, such as those of Bob-ombs and  Chuckyas . These are necessary for  Quick Release  and are also the basis for the  Bloated Bob-omb  and  Handsfree Teleported Bob-omb  glitches, which work because the Bob-omb's size is large enough that its hitbox pushes Mario back, but it moves with him because he's holding it. Clone hitboxes Cloned objects that Mario can pick up normally act normal when set down, and have normal hitboxes. However, clones of objects never meant to be held have odd hitboxes. The majority of them can be interacted with only once by Mario, if at all. Platforms are intangible, and most enemies can injure Mario once and then become intangible. Coins can only be collected once, but don't disappear.  Shells  and  Bullies  are exceptions to this rule, as they can be interacted with multiple times. Overshadowing Clone hitboxes overshadow the hitboxes of other clones of the same type. For example, Mario can release a  fire  clone and will immediately get burned by it. Then, he can stand in its (now dormant) hitbox to release another without getting burned. This serves many purposes in the  A Button Challenge , including  Bowser in the Sky  and  Tick Tock Clock ."}

Version 2  is used here, using the coins from Boos and Mr. I as primary sources. The version later than Star 2 is used as otherwise the merry-go-round would not have boos flying out. The red coins on the bookshelf are the trickiest ones the collect since Boos and flying books need to be manipulated. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge , with  Eye to Eye in the Secret Room  requiring  Hyperspeed Wall Jumps  to clip into the room. In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected, as they all require entering doors. In the  Pacifist Challenge ,  Secret of the Haunted Books  and  Seek the 8 Red Coins  can be collected in isolation. However, they cannot be collected in a full-game run because Big Boo's Haunt requires killing a Boo to enter. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Secret of the Haunted Books  can be collected in isolation. However, Big Boo's Haunt cannot be entered at all in a full-game run, because it requires killing a Boo to enter. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to get more coins than intended.

This version contains King Bob-omb and without the extra bowling ball and Koopa shell. Bob-omb buddy is not present. Version 2 : Accessed by selecting Star 2. This version contains Koopa the Quick and the extra bowling ball but without the Koopa shell. Bob-omb buddy is present to unlock the cannon. Version 3 : Accessed by selecting Star 3 through Star 6.

Coins Bob-omb Battlefield has a total of 146 coins collectible without the aid of glitches, but only 141 coins can be collected with the first three stars selected. With the aid of glitches, the number of coins can be raised, namely by using the  breaking-disappearing cork box glitch ,  cloning , or  ride canceling . Cloning can only produce a certain amount of coins before the object limit is reached, but the cork box and Koopa shell glitches can be used to get infinite coins.

The Wing Cap, unlocked by pressing the switch in  Tower of the Wing Cap , is required to complete  Mario Wings to the Sky  (by using  Hat-in-Hand  glitch). Though, it may be possible to use  Behind Camera Anywhere  instead of the wing cap, but it is unverified.

Big Bob-omb on the Summit  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/h8MjSIMekrg   Scaling the mountain is easily done even without using the teleporters near the flowers or using the mountain warp. As the geometry of the course is mostly flat, there should be no difficulty even when climbing up the mountain. Simply scale the mountain and defeat King Bob-omb without pressing A.  Footrace with Koopa The Quick  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/ERlN9BDxBcw   This one is harder as it involves speed, but still possible. Talk to Koopa the Quick and start running. The tilting bridge can be crossed by waiting a while at one end, then slide kicking off of the other. Afterwards, simply scale the mountain. At no point is pressing A mandatory. Shoot to the Island in the Sky  (0x) Video 1 (Goomba Bridge):  https://youtu.be/54iInYhelg4   Video 2 (Shell Hyperspeed):  https://youtu.be/vGCclfj6YC0   Completing this star is not easy. Initially, Pannenkoek ended up constructing a  Goomba Bridge  to get to the island and placing a Bowling Ball directly underneath the star. Grabbing a cork box, he went back up his Goomba Bridge and grabbed it as it turned fake to clone another Goomba. Finally, he released the Goomba by getting knocked back by the bowling ball and opened the star's item block using the said knockback, then the Goomba clone facilitated Mario to gain enough height to reach the star, as the star is 313 units above ground [2] . Eventually, in 2017, Pannenkoek used Shell Hyperspeed to complete the star by accumulating negative speed with the shell, reaching over -440 with which he went to the mountaintop, and launching towards the floating island. Mario then ground pounds the item block in midair to collect the star. Find the 8 Red Coins  (0x) Video 1 (Goomba Bridge):  https://youtu.be/9RUSM-aqQeM   Video 2 (Shell Hyperspeed):  https://youtu.be/BB5RpMUNAV4   Since most of the coins are relatively easy to get, all effort goes into the one red coin located on the floating island. Luckily, there are many ways to collect it. In the initial run, Pannenkoek utilized the previously mentioned  Goomba Bridge , as seen in the previous star. After the seven other coins were easily collected, he constructed a Goomba Bridge towards the island.  Eventually, in the second video, Pannenkoek used Shell Hyperspeed to accumulate high negative speed with the shell and launches towards the floating island using the previously described method. The shell also has the benefit of speeding up the collection of the remaining coins. Mario Wings to the Sky  (0x) Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpcMlj8BwWE   The first three secrets can be collected by using  Shell Hyperspeed  and launching off the top of the mountain. The other two secrets are way too high for that, so Pannenkoek had to use a different. Pannenkoek first sets the HOLP at a precise point high above the floating island by making a  Goomba Bridge  with 28 Goomba clones. He then exits the course to unload them, so the game wouldn't crash from the large number of Goomba clones. After re-entering, he uses the shell to reach the first three secrets, before performing the Hat-in Hand glitch. He uses  Transport Cloning  to create a  Goomba Oasis  with 7 precisely-placed Goomba clones that end up near the highest secret. He then creates another Goomba Bridge with 36 Goomba clones that led up to the Goomba Oasis. After that, he was able to use the Goomba Bridge to reach the 5th secret, then use the Goombas in the Oasis to turn around and fall into the 4th secret. This strategy uses 43 Goomba clones, which is a lot for the game to handle. This is why the was impossible to collect 0xA before the discovery of the Goomba Cluster and Goomba Oasis, as earlier strategies would have many more Goombas and would undoubtedly crash the game. Behind Chain Chomp's Gate  (0x) Video 1 (Goomba clone):  https://youtu.be/s87uNx50j38   Video 2 (Shell Hyperspeed):  https://youtu.be/7s2qptzjcJ8   Video 3 (Death Clip):  https://youtu.be/F5n5csEyCws Getting Behind the Gate is easy, but getting the star is not. First, Pannenkoek did some manipulation to reliably get Goomba  clones . Then, he went behind the gate using a cork box and used that same box to clone the Goombas in such a way that he could ascend to the star using a  Goomba Staircase .  Eventually, in the second video, Pannenkoek uses Shell Hyperspeed to accumulate higher than -500 speed to clip behind the gate with enough height to collect the star behind the gate. BoB 100 Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/gSVIl_DMyXc   This star requires getting all coins except the one red on the Floating Island and the coins in  Mario Wings to the Sky . After collecting the easily accessible coins, Pannenkoek  clones  a singular yellow coin for the star. Even without cloning, the shiny shell (accessible from Star 3 onward) can also greatly facilitate in collecting the coins of the course and reach the floating island via  Backwards Shell Hyperspeed . Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected.  Mario Wings to the Sky  is the most challenging mission to complete, as it requires the use of  Parallel Universes  for the first four secrets and a complicated setup to achieve a high  VSC  while holding a fake object for the fifth secret [3] . The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  Find the 8 Red Coins ,  Behind Chain Chomp's Gate , and  100 Coins  can be collected [4] . In a  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , all seven stars can be collected without using the joystick. However, some of these stars are completed using the  Wing Cap , which can not be obtained during a full-game run, as it requires looking up in the castle. [5] . In the  Pacifist Challenge , every star except for  Big Bob-omb on the Summit  can be collected in isolation. However,  Footrace with Koopa the Quick  can not be collected in a full-game run since it is impossible to select. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 3 B presses, all three used to pick up King Bob-omb. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses.  Behind Chain Chomp's Gate  requires a bomb clip to avoid ground pounding on the post. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Shoot to the Island in the Sky  and  Behind Chain Chomp's Gate  can be collected. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to ground pound on Chain Chomp's post without interacting with the red coin.

There are two variants of the course, the \"tiny\" one and the \"huge\" one. In the level are many pipes which take you back and forth between the two. The level is themed around going from one world to another, and interacting with how the size changes affect the world. There are 2 paintings leading to THI, on the second floor behind a door with a star on it. One is a smaller painting which takes you directly to the tiny version of the course, and the other is a much larger painting that takes you to the huge version of the course Contents 1   Star Select Info 2   Tips 3   120 Route 4   70 Route 5   70 Route (with THI Reds) Star Select Info Act 1: No Koopa : When any star other than Rematch with Koopa the Quick (Star 3) is selected, neither Koopa the Quick nor his flag will spawn.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Tick Tock Clock)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way. No Joystick Allowed The 100 coin star is currently used to reset Mario's ascent of steep slopes, which is useful near the top of the pyramid in  Shifting Sand Land  to collect the stars  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  and  Pyramid Puzzle .

{"prompt": "Explain Indefinite owl flight", "completion": "Indefinite Owl Flight  is a glitch which allows Mario to use Hoot to go upward indefinitely. To perform the glitch, Mario must let go of Hoot, pause the game before losing too much height, wait 30 frames, and then unpause the game. After unpausing Mario will grab onto Hoot again, bypassing the normal cooldown time that normally occurs when Mario lets go and allowing him to fly up with Hoot indefinitely. The glitch occurs because the game determines whether sufficient time has passed for Mario to regrab Hoot by comparing the value of the global timer when Mario let go of Hoot with the current value of the global timer.

Usually, this Bob-omb explodes. But if you grab it right before the explosion, it will be delayed for 12 frames. Note that if the explosion is early (by throwing the Bob-omb on the ground) It won't explode until the timer expires. The explosion is delayed, but the Bob-omb stays big, which means that its hitbox is bigger, enough to push Mario backwards. Maintaining a Bloated State After grabbing the bloated Bob-omb, you have to walk, then the Bob-omb will start exploding again, then you have to re-grab the Bob-omb. During these small frames of walking, you will be able to turn. Another way of keeping it is by holding it  Hands-free . You will be able to jump, jumpkick, double jump, triple jump, and ground pound. You can't turn except if you have a  Wing Cap , where you will be able to fly while being pushed backwards. Hands-free Teleported Bloated Bob-omb If you teleport while holding a Bob-omb  Hands-free , This Bob-omb will disappear. But if you go close to the first teleporter or if you teleport back, the Bob-omb will appear in front of you, giving you backwards momentum while keeping almost every movement. You can grab that Bob-omb by diving or punching. Kicking will cancel the momentum. Uses This trick is used frequently in the  A Button Challenge , but also generally for clipping through walls, such as in  the Chain Chomp's Gate clip. Interaction with walls The game first adds the speed to the current position and uses that point in the collision calculations. The algorithm will push the bob-omb outward from the wall if a collision occurs, so if it's already against the wall it effectively adds the component of the bob-omb's speed that's tangent to the wall. Regardless of whether a collision occurs or not, the Bob-omb's position is incremented by its speed at a later point as well. Finally, since the point used for the collision calculation is only written to the Bob-omb's position if a collision occurs, the double speed increment doesn't happen in the open field. This occurs before the Bob-omb's actual movement step, so then it moves a 2nd time before the frame ends. Thus, when Bob-ombs touch a wall, their speed is effectively doubled. Basically, Bob-ombs always check for wall collision before moving. If they do collide with a wall hitbox, then the Bob-omb's position is incremented and pushed away by the wall. Supersaturated Bob-omb A supersaturated Bob-omb is a Bob-omb whose fuse timer has overflowed, which vastly delays its explosion. Because the underlying glitch takes 828 days (2.3 years) to execute, it is the most time-consuming glitch in the game.

{"prompt": "Explain Time Stop", "completion": "Time stop  (also known as  Timestop ) is a game mechanic present in all versions of SM64. There is a trick exclusive to the  J 1.0  version, which allows  Mario  to move around when objects are frozen due to a text box that is supposed to appear. Contents 1   Intended Behavior 2   Glitch 2.1   Proximity Textboxes 2.2   Holdable Object Textboxes 3   Effects 3.1   Infinite Coins 4   Other Versions of SM64 Intended Behavior The intended behavior of the Time Stop mechanism is to freeze everything except  Mario  and the talking object when Mario is in a textbox. Alternatively, during a star spawning cutscene, all objects are frozen (including Mario) excluding any stars that are spawning. Glitch On the  J 1.0  version of SM64, queueing a textbox immediately stops time for everything besides the talking object and Mario,  regardless if Mario is actually in a state to see the textbox . This can be exploited to move around stages with everything besides Mario and the talking object frozen. There are two ways to activate the Time Stop trick, proximity textboxes and textboxes from holdable objects. Neither way works with all textboxes of either type. Proximity Textboxes \"Proximity Textboxes\" are defined as textboxes that appear when Mario is near an object. If  Mario  jumps right when the textbox is about to activate, then Mario will be able to move in midair until he touches ground again, after which the textbox will start. While Mario is in the air, time will be stopped. Holdable Object Textboxes By picking up an object that normally triggers a text box and then dropping it before it can display the textbox, time stop can be activated. Mario can safely touch the ground and move around at this point without restarting time. The only known example of this type of Time Stop is the lower  Ukiki  in Tall Tall Mountain. Time is not stopped for the object that was used to stop it in either case. Effects Objects (in most cases) stay inanimate, and keep the exact same state they were in when time was stopped. If an object was intangible due to being far from Mario, it will stay intangible even when Mario comes near it until time is started again, because objects do not update in time stop. Infinite Coins If a coin is collected during time stop, the coin counter will increment but the coin object will not unload until the textbox finishes. If the player enters a warp to cancel the textbox, it is possible to repeat the procedure infinitely since the coin is never unloaded. Other Versions of SM64 The developers patched this glitch in all versions of the game besides J 1.0, by making sure that time does not stop until a textbox is in the process of being displayed. Time still stops for textboxes on other versions, but there is no known way to move around during this state. The proximity method for Time Stop is still possible in other versions, but time does not stop and the textbox does not appear until Mario touches the ground. This allows for tricks such as getting a 0.0 time on  Koopa the Quick  in both of their races."}

The star is too high to get using a dive recover, so instead 2  Goomba   Clones  are used. Mario can use a cork box to clip inside the gate. The first problem is that it is impossible to clone a goomba inside the gate, so instead mario places the  Cork Box  at the desired location of a goomba clone. Mario can easily leave the gate as the gate is a one-sided wall. Mario uses the  Hat in Hand  glitch to release a goomba clone at the location of the box, since that\u2019s where the  HOLP  is at.

A faster strategy was found by Plush in mid 2016. Mario used a  Bob-omb  to push him out of bounds and clip inside from the side. Mario then collects the star while the death transition happens. The death cancels out the star grabbing, saving lots of time. Timing is different when using this death clip strategy. Instead of stopping when Mario collects the star, the timer stops on the first frame of the bowser death screen, as that determines how fast the run is.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Tall, Tall Mountain)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves.

{"prompt": "Explain Camera", "completion": "The camera system was a first of its kind system, considering  Mario 64  was one of the first 3D platforming games. The system makes use of a sometimes dynamic, sometimes hard-coded presets and modes to make the camera work for its given situation.  Contents 1   History 2   Modes 2.1   Player Controlled Modes 2.1.1   Lakitu Camera 2.1.2   Mario Camera 2.1.3   Fixed Camera 2.2   Camera Controlled Modes 2.2.1   No Mode 2.2.2   Open 2.2.3   Reverse Tower 2.2.4   Behind Mario 2.2.5   Close 2.2.6   C Up 2.2.7   Water Surface 2.2.8   Slide 2.2.9   Inside Cannon 2.2.10   Boss Fight 2.2.11   Parallel Tracking 2.2.12   Fixed Reference 2.2.13   Bowser Level 2.2.14   Free Roam 2.2.15   Spiral Stairs 2.2.16   Wobble History The camera was supposedly solely written by Takumi Kawagoe, a developer who also helped write the camera for Ocarina of Time. [1]  Most of the insight on the camera development comes from interviews with Kawagoe and fellow developer Giles Goddard, as well as the a Nintendo 64 patent that details information on the camera. Modes The camera consists of several types of modes, beyond the types the player controls. These change depending on the situation, altering  angles  and positions to try and adapt for the situation. In each of these sections, generally only one specific mode is utilized in a group at a time. Player Controlled Modes These modes are modes that the player controls, specifically by usage of changing in the pause menu and using the R button. The idea for these was to help allow players to overcome camera issues and play the game as they want. Lakitu Camera This is default camera mode, representing a camera that supposedly is carried by Lakitu. The camera will keep  Mario  in focus while attempting to give a clear angle of the geometry around Mario. Mario Camera The default alternative camera mode, this one is selected by usage of the R button. Pressing the button puts the camera into a mode that more closely follows Mario, akin to a zoomed-out first person mode. This can often override other hidden modes, and provides a typically abnormal perspective. Fixed Camera This mode must be selected through the pause menu. While holding R with the option selected, the camera will stop moving and will only continue to angle to follow Mario. This can be abused, as preventing the camera from moving will keep it from travelling to  PUs - which  crash  the game. Camera Controlled Modes These modes are activated by many different scenarios, such as the level/area loading,  water ,  actions ,  floors , and  objects . Although these modes are not actively noticed, they greatly control the behavior of the camera. The camera can act almost completely different depending on the mode. No Mode This mode (or rather, lack of mode) is used when on certain screens. The title screen and file select screen use this. This keeps the things being looked at in view and the camera from moving in these set situations. Open Could be viewed as the default camera. Most levels use this, such as  BoB ,  CCM ,  LLL , and  SSL . The camera follows decently far away, and gives minimal control in regards to C button zooming. Reverse Tower In Reverse Tower mode, the camera follow either along a vertical axis or stays on a line between the focus and the axis. This gives a perspective as if Mario is climbing around the outside of a structure, with the camera staying in the middle. Areas that use this include the first  DDD  area,  TTC , and the volcano in  LLL . Behind Mario This mode follows decently strictly behind Mario, with the C side buttons giving a 90 degree view from the side while held. This isn't set by default in any levels, but is applied after  cannon  shots or while swimming underwater. Close Similar to the open camera, except this mode follows Mario closer. It is set by default in stages such as  BBH  and Eyerok's Lair. C Up As the name implies, this is a sort of first-person mode that activates whenever Mario reads a sign or C Up is pressed. This allows to look at places where the camera normally won't go to. Water Surface Slide Inside Cannon This camera is activated in a singular situation, when  Mario  enters a  cannon . It acts similar to the C Up mode, where moving the joystick looks around. Boss Fight This camera is activated when fighting certain enemies, specifically King Bob-omb, King Whomp, and  Bowser . Specifically, the  floor  activates for the first two and the latter are loaded in with the level. This mode makes the camera zoom out to allow both the normal focus and a secondary focus (i.e. the boss) on screen. The zooms the camera much farther out. Parallel Tracking In this mode, the camera moves along a line and tracks the focus. Outside of cutscenes, the only use of this is in the library in  BBH . Fixed Reference This mode essentially locks the camera, and prevents the camera from getting stuck on a variety of  surfaces . This is useful for many rooms, and is utilized in the castle and  BBH  mansion. Bowser Level Free Roam Spiral Stairs Wobble The camera wobbles during the animation of running out of health on the ground, and in some cases during the star collecting animation (the other possibility being for it to zoom out). \u2191   Iwata Asks: The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess"}
{"prompt": "Explain Lethal Lava Land Drawbridge", "completion": "Lethal Lava Land Drawbridge Technical Constants Object Group Surface The  Lethal Lava Land Drawbridge  is an object appearing in  Lethal Lava Land . The drawbridge raises and lowers itself, as the name would imply. Behavior Each part of the drawbridge is spawned by the drawbridge spawner. The two pieces of the drawbridge are spawned with opposite angles and are offset from the spawner position so that they will face each other. Once the parts are in place, the spawner deactivates. The drawbridge pieces have two possible actions: a lowering action and a raising action. When the object is in the lowering action, its facing roll angle is incremented by 0.703125 degrees each frame until this angle is above zero. Once the angle is above zero, it is immediately set to zero and after 50 frames have passed it can begin the raising action. However, the raising action can only begin is the global timer's value is divisible by 8, so strategically pausing and unpausing the game can make the bridge stay lowered indefinitely. If the drawbridge is in the raising action, its facing roll angle is decremented by 0.703125 degrees per frame until this angle is below -44.98 degrees. Once the angle is below this value, it is immediately set to the value 315 degrees, or -45 degrees and after 50 frames have passed it can begin the lowering action. Once again, the lowering action can only begin is the global timer's value is divisible by 8, so strategically pausing and unpausing the game can make the bridge stay raised indefinitely as before.

{"prompt": "Explain HOLP", "completion": "The HOLP Technique was originally created by Sonicwiifan [1]  and Pannenkoek2012 [2] . The  HOLP , short for  Held Object's Last Position , represents the coordinates at which the object  Mario  held last was last rendered. The HOLP is not reset when changing  courses  or files, but is reset to the origin ([0, 0, 0]) when starting the game. When released, objects are re-activated and placed at the HOLP, which is usually in front of  Mario . However, if the object was not rendered while being held by Mario, the HOLP would not update during that time, so the object won't appear in front of Mario. A similar effect can be observed with the anchor point when executing a  Chuckya Wrong Throw . The HOLP is specifically not updated when- The camera is 20,300 units away The camera is panned away from Mario With  Hat in Hand  (as the object doesn't load) During  Pause-Buffered Hitstun Using  instant release Holding an object   behind the camera By changing a model to be blank using  spiny adoption  (cork box only, which doesn't occur in vanilla) Effect on Objects When an object is thrown, it will appear at the HOLP.

{"prompt": "Explain ABZ Challenge", "completion": "ABZ Button Challenge Abbreviation ABZ Individual stars collectible 34 Overall stars collectible 0 Is beatable No Presses required for Any% 79 Presses required for 120-Star 614 Star Details BoB WF JRB CCM BBH HMC LLL SSL DDD SL WDW TTM THI TTC RR Secret Castle Bowser The  ABZ Button Challenge , also known as  the ABZ challenge ,  ABZBC , or  ABZ  for short, is a  challenge  in which the total sum of A, B, and Z  button presses  is minimized. For example, pressing the A button once is better than pressing B once and Z once or the B button twice, while pressing the Z button once is better than pressing the A button twice. The ABZ Button Challenge is unique in that it aims to minimize the sum of three values, rather than any of those values individually. For example, although it may be possible to obtain a  star   without pressing A , it is often the case that doing so requires many B presses; the converse holds as well. Thus, the way one approaches the ABZ Button Challenge is frequently very different from related challenges.   Textboxes  constitute a majority of the ABZ presses in current routes. Advancing through text requires pressing either the A or the B button, meaning that minimizing A, B, and Z presses also leads to minimizing the amount of text presented in-game. In the  European/PAL  version, the game's language can be selected after each  Save and Quit . Thus, in this version, one can change the game's language between English, German, and French without incurring any ABZ presses. Players use this mechanic in order to choose the language with the fewest textboxes at any given time. The best version of the game in the current route is the  PAL Wii VC  version because of  BitFS Platform Raising , which saves an A press in the any% run. The project was conceptualized by  User:Welcoe , with much of the current progress being made since early 2018. There are currently 2 spreadsheets for the ABZ challenge: the  TAS  spreadsheet [1]  and the  RTA  spreadsheet [2] . The current amount of ABZ presses is not yet confirmed, as the initial routing for the challenge is not yet complete.

Due to the lack of confirmation of how many ABZ presses are needed for the normal challenge, the number of ABZ presses needed for this challenge is not known either but should be significantly lower than normal.

{"prompt": "Explain Tox Box", "completion": "Tox Box Technical Constants Object Group Surface Actor Group N/A Draw Distance 8000 The  Tox Box  is an enemy in  Shifting Sand Land . The enemy moves in a set pattern and will crush Mario is he is caught below it. Contents 1   Behavior 1.1   Movement Function 1.2   Actions 1.3   Movement Patterns 2   References Behavior Movement Function The Tox Box movement function takes 4 parameters; 2 floats (a0 and a1) and 2 shorts (a2 and a3). The Y-position of Tox Box is given as: Y = 99.41124 sin \u2061 ( 2 15 ( timer + 1 ) / 8 ) + Y home + 3 {\\displaystyle Y=99.41124\\sin(2^{15}({\\text{timer}}+1)/8)+Y_{\\text{home}}+3} Its forward velocity is set to a0 and its z-velocity is set to a1. Its pitch facing angle is increased by a2 whenever the function runs. If this angle is less than 0, a3 is set to negative a3 and its roll facing angle is increased by a3 whenever the function runs. After 8 frames, the Tox Box moves into another action and plays a sound. Actions Tox Box has 1 initialization action and 7 actions used to control its movement. When Tox Box is initialized the game checks which parameter it has to assign its movement pattern. Action 1 sets the forward velocity to 0, shakes the screen for one frame if Mario is close enough and increases its Y-value by 3. After 21 frames, the next action occurs. Actions 2 and 3 simply keep the Tox Box in its current position for 21 frames. Action 4 runs the movement function with the parameters (64,0,0x800,0). Action 5 runs the movement function with the parameters (-64,0,-0x800,0). Action 6 runs the movement function with the parameters (0,-64,0,0x800). Action 7 runs the movement function with the parameters (0,64,0,-0x800). Movement Patterns There are three movement patterns used for Tox Box. Each consists of a list of numbers corresponding to one of the 7 movement actions. Every other action in the list is action 1, which halts the Tox Box for 21 frames, and each ends with -1, looping to the start of the list. Action 2 is used to freeze the Tox Box for an additional 20 frames before it reverses direction and Action 3 is never used. The Tox Box takes 8 frames to make a full movement, during which it moves 11.25 degrees per frame and 64 units/frame in the direction it is moving in.

However, it takes 0 A presses to beat the level (with or without the red coin star) in the any% category, because the  Wii VC  version is used instead. The A press is required to  jump off the pole , which was saved on the  Wii VC  version using the  Wii VC Rounding to Zero  glitch. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , the key can be collected. It can also be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , both the star and key can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , neither the star nor key can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , both the star and key can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , both the star and key can be collected, as  Bowser  is an exception to the pacifist rule. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 1 B press, to grab Bowser. Bowser does not need to be released with B, since Mario can just drop him into a mine. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge , the key can be collected. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: getting infinite coins, collecting the  key  on the death barrier, and reaching a  Parallel Universe  in the Bowser fight. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Courses Main Courses First Floor Bob-omb Battlefield  \u2022  Whomp's Fortress  \u2022  Jolly Roger Bay  \u2022  Cool, Cool Mountain  \u2022  Big Boo's Haunt Basement Hazy Maze Cave  \u2022  Lethal Lava Land  \u2022  Shifting Sand Land  \u2022  Dire, Dire Docks Second Floor Snowman's Land  \u2022  Wet-Dry World  \u2022  Tall, Tall Mountain  \u2022  Tiny-Huge Island Third Floor Tick Tock Clock  \u2022  Rainbow Ride Special Courses The Castle The Castle Bowser Stages Bowser in the Dark World  \u2022  Bowser in the Fire Sea  \u2022  Bowser in the Sky Secret Courses The Princess's Secret Slide  \u2022  Secret Aquarium  \u2022  Wing Mario over the Rainbow Switch Courses Tower of the Wing Cap  \u2022  Vanish Cap under the Moat  \u2022  Cavern of the Metal Cap"}

It should be noted, however, that with speed conservation, it is possible to enter the course with 0 stars by exiting  Bob-omb Battlefield  with 227 stored speed, redirect Mario's direction using the second key door text, and clip through the 8-star door. This allows entering Bowser in the Dark World with zero stars. The strategy is vital as part of the plan for entering  Secret Aquarium  in 0 A presses. Within the course  (0x) With red coins:  https://youtu.be/UCmPvInKa9E   Without red coins:  https://youtu.be/b0vDJmsvVBw   Mario is able to navigate the course without the use of A button to jump, as the geometry is mostly flat. The elevators can be reached with a precise dive recover. Throughout the course, there are three difficult sections:  The Crystal , named after its vicinity to the nearby structure that is too high to reach with a dive recover, where there is a yellow back-and-forth platform below;  The Seesaws , where they must be tilted to very steep angles to reach the red coins;  The Warp Pipe , where a misalignment must be utilized to get on top to enter the Bowser fight. An optional section of  The 4th/6th Red Coin  is required if red coins are collected. The Crystal Old Strategy (VSC):  https://youtu.be/6eI8D85WG7w   New Strategy (207 DR):  https://youtu.be/U4vcFxz0F3g   This section is named after the object that originally facilitated Mario to reach the next structure via  Vertical Speed Conservation . As the Crystal has a strange hitbox, it displaces Mario's position if he gets into a certain spot, allowing him to store 26 vertical speed. Mario then punches towards the structure with the yellow moving platform, duck down to avoid the amps hitting him, and pops onto the structure, saving an otherwise mandatory A press in a full game run. Later, Tyler Kehne demonstrated that a very precise dive recover to utilize the  misalignment  is possible in the course. It was previously thought to be impossible due to the inconvenient angle, but it was eventually worked out on May 5, 2018, with diligent efforts of Iwer Sonsch and bad_boot, while Jongyon worked on the math calculations. The 4th/6th Red Coin Originally, for this optional segment for red coins, Mario had to bump into a Goomba, luring it to drop onto a narrow bridge. Mario then left to collect the 6th red coin on the lonely island and then came back to bounce on the Goomba, getting back into the main segment. Later, Lord SNEK proposed a  timesave  where Mario would go straight from the platform with the 207 DR to the platform with the spire, then do a precise rollout back onto a platform nearby. This was solved by Jongyon and Iwer Sonsch. It's now done as the 4th red coin. The Seesaws Tilting the seesaw and using frame-walking to reach the higher platforms is sufficient, yet it can be done even faster by dive-recovering on steep slopes using pause buffer. Therefore, Mario has no problems getting past the seesaws and reach the bottom of the activatable stairs. Mario also has no issues getting the remaining two red coins for the red coin star in the 100% run. The Warp Pipe Instead of activating the stairs to get up, Mario grinds on the slope with repeated dives to gradually rise to the top of the stairs. If Mario collected all red coins, he would now collect the star. Afterwards, Mario aims at one of the misalignments of the warp pipe and lands on the pipe with a precise 207 dive recover to avoid the wall hitboxes and snap onto the top of the pipe. Finally, Mario defeats Bowser in the fight and collects the first key of the game. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , the key can be collected. It can also be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , both the star and key can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , neither the key nor star can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , only the key can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , both the star and key can be collected, as  Bowser  is an exception to the pacifist rule. Defeating Bowser in this course is not required anyway because the fight can be bypassed with the  Moat Door Skip . In the  B Button Challenge , the key requires 1 B press to grab Bowser. However, this is not necessary to do because the entire fight can be skipped with Moat Door Skip. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge , the key can be collected. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to reach a  Parallel Universe  from both areas of the level.

{"prompt": "Explain Death Barrier", "completion": "The  death barrier  or  death plane  is a special type of  floor  that causes Mario to lose a  life  if he is above it and vertically within 2048  units  of it. It is analogous to the bottomless pits of previous games. A floor is used for this case since Mario cannot inhabit any region without a floor triangle underneath him, as that is considered  Out of Bounds . The death animation triggers well above the physical height of a Death Barrier in order to avoid having Mario stand on it. However, it can be  downwarped  to or stood upon during a  Power Star  cutscene, and Mario's shadow is still visible on the surface of the Death Barrier, as with any other floor. The death barrier can also be reached by flying downwards using the  Wing Cap  with a lot of speed (doable without hacks in  TotWC  and  WMotR ). Several  objects , such as  Goombas  and  Scuttlebugs , have special programming in place to despawn them if they reach the death barrier, to prevent them from walking around on top of it. The  Mystery Goomba  only exists for one  frame , as it spawns at the death barrier and consequently despawns as soon as possible, and at the same time is too far away from Mario to be able to load."}

Entering Shifting Sand Land  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/mlHzqJn2SMs?t=2m13s   The painting disguised as a wall can be entered by dive-recovering into it. In the Talons of the Big Bird  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/ww82yJUtnok   Near one of the four pillars, there is a crazy box nearby, which Mario can grab at the right moment to touch Klepto once the crazy box is at its peak. Mario then grabs the star. Shining Atop the Pyramid  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/9LUnFXtny2U   Using the same crazy box, Mario aims towards the top of the pyramid instead and swiftly grabs the star there. Even without this strategy, the star can still be reached by twirling from a Shy Guy and then walking up the pyramid while burned by a Keronpa Ball. Inside the Ancient Pyramid  (1x) Video:  https://youtu.be/-7rhANlmuDE   Navigating up the pyramid from the bottom (standard) entrance to the top costs 1 A Presses [2]  using known strategies, but it is faster to complete by entering the pyramid from the top. Unfortunately, the barriers around the elevator are 7 units too high for a dive recover to clear, and therefore an A press must be used to jump out of the elevator. Mario jumps from the elevator th the star. Stand Tall on the Four Pillars  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/Lh0HKRw1p5E?si=Br345uF-bfsKv6HR The biggest obstacle is to get to Eyerok's boss fight without pressing A. To do so, Mario needs to get on top of the wire mesh to access the teleporter via wrong-warping (the teleporter is intended to be one-way, but it can be activated by standing on a slightly higher ground). That way, Mario can enter the room from above, normally accessed by standing on top of the four pillars and riding down on the elevator. To get onto reach the wire mesh, Mario uses a precise goomba bounce. Free Flying for 8 Red Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/53yVvpNQHQg   The most difficult red coins to collect is the four midair red coins, one of which being closest to Mario is the hardest to get, as it is not far enough to be reached by a shy guy or a crazy box alone. The extra tornadoes do not spawn until this star is completed. However, with better strategies manipulating a Shy Guy, Mario can get it to appear at the right location and keep it at a lunging state with the crazy box's bounce, allowing it to move higher than intended. Mario then bounces on it from the peak of the crazy box, collecting the red coin while twirling. Without this strategy, Pokey clones would have been required. The remaining red coins in the air can be collected using a combination of tornadoes and shy guys. The location where the star is spawned is almost off-limits for Mario to reach as it requires a shy guy that is used up for the first coin. The fastest way for Mario to collect it is to clone the star. Nonetheless, even without cloning, Mario can still reach the high platform by precisely bouncing on a goomba and a pokey  [3] . Pyramid Puzzle  (1x) Video:  https://youtu.be/p4URidbSP88   Just like Inside the Ancient Pyramid, navigating up the pyramid from the bottom (standard) entrance to the top costs 1 A Presses [2]  using known strategies, but it is faster to complete by entering the pyramid from the top. Unfortunately, the barriers around the elevator are 7 units too high for a dive recover to clear, and therefore an A press must be used to jump out of the elevator. After jumping from the elevator, Mario just collects all the secrets and collects the star. SSL 100 coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/92LrcsRjTLI   Collecting various coins. Mario can opt to clone the box for more coins and eventually reach 100 coins without having to enter the pyramid. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected.  Pyramid Puzzle  requires precise jump kicks over the five coins to collect the secrets without touching the coins. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected.  Free Flying for 8 Red Coins  requires using  Fly Guys  and  Tornados  to reach the high red coins. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  In the Talons of the Big Bird ,  Shining Atop the Pyramid , and  Free Flying for 8 Red Coins  can be collected. They make heavy use of twirls from Fly Guys and Tornados. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , every star except for  Stand Tall on the Four Pillars  can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Shining Atop the Pyramid  and  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  can be collected. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to reach a  Parallel Universe  in the  Eyerok  boss room.

The main theme of this course is a clock. This level's core focus is in platforming with variable part movement in the clock. Like  Rainbow Ride  and other open air courses, Mario can fall into the  death barrier  at any time, from any height. Contents 1   Clock Settings 2   Upwarp 3   Coins 4   A Press Counts 4.1   Spawning Displacement A Press Saves 5   Other Challenges 6   Trivia 7   References Clock Settings   The possible clock settings and their required angles. Tick Tock Clock has four clock settings. Each one depends on the position of the  minute hand  of the clock  painting  when Mario enters it. The clock settings are still, slow, fast, and random. Each clock setting affects the behavior of the moving  objects  within Tick Tock Clock, detailed under their specific object pages. Specifically, the following objects take into account the clock setting: Spinners Cogs Rotating blocks Moving bars Pendulums Elevators Treadmills In general: On the still setting, moving and rotating platforms do not attempt to move. The  Thwomp , however, still moves.  Pedro spots  are common on this setting. This setting was once used for the  A Button Challenge  because of a specific Pedro spot on the  cogs . On the slow setting, moving and rotating platforms move slowly. On the fast setting, moving and rotating platforms move quickly. Using  Vertical Speed Conservation  on an  elevator , the most vertical speed can be stored on the fast setting compared to other settings. On the random setting, most objects call  RNG  to determine their movement. This setting is used for the A Button Challenge, the  ABZ Button Challenge , the  Buttonless Challenge , and many more because of its potential for manipulation. On this setting, there is potential for  squish cancel  on the  moving bars  and  pendulums , and  pendulum manipulation  is also possible. There is a Pedro spot on a certain  pendulum box  that saved 3 A presses on  Stomp on the Thwomp [1]  that exists on every setting, but it is only possible to enter it with pendulum manipulation on the random setting. [2] Upwarp See also:  History Of The TTC Upwarp ,  List of Unsolved Glitches In 2013, speedrunner DOTA_Teabag managed to capture an  upwarp  glitch during a speedrun race with MidBoss. 2 years later, due to the inability to replicate this upwarp,  pannenkoek2012  placed a US$1,000 bounty for anyone who could replicate and record the upwarp in  Mupen64 [3] . The bounty has not yet been claimed, and the upwarp has yet to be replicated. However, in May of 2020, a runner named dumpdome64 ran into a similar glitch while practicing the Tick Tock Clock 100 Coin Star route. [4]  While practicing, a push block from high in the course suddenly appeared much lower in the course, at a Y-position close to 0. In addition, Mario's shadow became glitched for 1 frame at several points later on. Preliminary analysis suggests that all of these glitches were the result of a single bit being changed for 1 frame and a connection between these and the upwarp is possible. Coins There are 128 coins naturally in the course. With  cloning , it is possible to clone 127 extra coins to bring the coin count to 255, or clone 151 coins to bring the coin count to 279 coins before the game crashes due to object slots.

It should be noted that it requires 1x A press to enter TTC, which is repeated three times. Spawning Displacement A Press Saves Mario can collect  Stop Time for Red Coins  on a  spinner  by  cloning  it. He can also collect both  The Pit and the Pendulums  and  Get a Hand [5]  on a spinner by  kicking  a  wall  as he collects them, allowing him to keep that momentum and fall across the course, landing on a spinner down below. These spinners can be used on the random setting to provide  spawning displacement  that allows Mario to spawn back on top of the clock, which saves 1 A press each time it is used [6] . Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  Get a Hand  and  Stop Time for Red Coins  can be collected. The former requires  Pendulum Manipulation  to reach the star. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , every star except for  Stomp on the Thwomp  and  100 Coins  can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses.  100 Coins  requires coin cloning to avoid ground pounding the  Blue Coin  block. In the  UBER Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: getting infinite coins and reaching a  Parallel Universe . Trivia Tick Tock Clock holds the distinction of having a shorter draw distance for objects compared to the other courses. The default draw distance for objects in Tick Tock Clock is 2000 units, half of the game's regular 4000 units.

{"prompt": "Explain DDD skip", "completion": "DDD Skip  is a trick that uses Mario's speed from BLJs to bypass the 1 Star requirement previously needed from  1 Star . It does this by bypassing  Dire, Dire Docks . The glitch works since Mario's speed is above 378, the speed proportional to the width of the Dire Dire Docks portal. This allows Mario to be on one side of the painting on 1 frame and behind it on the next. This page largely serves as an attempt to translate the information on the Japanese  DDD Skip Wiki  into English in a concise manner.

To start building speed, Mario must get some initial speed from the stairs that are across from the 30 Star door. As of 11/08/2021, there are 2 main methods to somewhat consistently get enough speed to continue to the next stage. Hat Setup SBLJ With regular Mario cam, hug the wall parallel to the stair and position Mario's left leg in the stair. Next, C-Down and create an angle where the tip of Mario's hat is aligned with a line on the wall. Try not to have Mario's left leg leave the top stair. When you are ready to do the SBLJ, hold down on the analog stick, quickly long jump, and hold up. Right before Mario hits the stair, hold up left on the analog stick and start pressing A (around 8-10/s). When Mario is exiting, after building enough speed, he should do an extra long jump on the pillar next to the stairs. Slight Angle SBLJ With regular Mario cam, hug the wall parallel to the stair and position Mario's left leg in the stair. Next, C-Down and create a slight angle relative to the camera using the analog stick. When you are ready to do the SBLJ, hold down on the analog stick, quickly long jump, and hold up. When Mario is about to hit the stairs and hold up left but slightly more up than left. At this point start mashing the A button (around 8-10/s). When Mario is exiting, after building enough speed, he should do an extra long jump on the pillar next to the stairs. Clipping the Fence When attempting the SBLJ there is a big chance to clip the fence next to the stair and lose all speed. There is one main way to avoid this. After Performing the SBLJ, right before Mario leaves the stairs (due to his speed), hold up on the analog stick. Instead of long jumping on the pillar, Mario will travel to the right of the pillar Holding up on the analog stick is usually after 6-9 A presses. While inconsistent, this is the only known way to avoid the fence. ABLJ Air Backwards Long Jump (ABLJ) is a type of BLJ in which Mario BLJ's in place while continuing to build up speed. This works since Mario's next intended position is unreachable. Mario builds up speed 1.5x to his current speed. Each frame Mario long jumps late by his speed is reduced by 1/50 his current speed. This is the phase after Mario leaves the stair with more than 70 speed and reaches the position left of the pillar next to the star door. The reason for this phase is to build up the speed (>418 for RTA) from >70 which is required to bypass the Dire Dire Docks Painting.  Mario Twitches During ABLJ Mario's movement on the left pillar is not random. Mario has 3 Possible directions to \"twitch\" in. Depending on what stage of ABLJ you are in, these twitches hold different meaning but their speed range, in which they occur, are consistent.

In this phase, Mario will always twitch to the left. After he is finished twitching to the left (usually 2-4 times) he will twitch twice to the right. On the second twitch to the right, we have exited the speed-building stage. Speed Control Stage At this stage, Mario's speed will need to be controlled to a specific range. A range in which DDD Skip will work (any Third count jump with less than 510 speed but more than 430 after the jump should work). During this phase, we will try to avoid building > 510 speed. At this high of a speed, Mario's speed will reset to 0 and DDD Skip would need to be restarted. First Count This stage begins on the first jump after the two right twitches from the Speed Building Stage, this special BLJ is called the \"First Count\". Every jump after this first count will need to be calculated. The main purpose of the first count is to notify you of the incoming Second Count. Second Count On the Jump after the First Count, Also known as the \"Second Count\", Mario will twitch in one of 3 ways. No Twitch, Right Twitch, and Left Twitch. How \"Violently\" - The speed at which the twitch is completed - Mario twitches in each direction can tell you more information about his current speed range. The jump after any of the four possible twitches is also known as the \"Third Count\" and should be the last ABLJ before \"exiting\" and going towards the star door. Any reference to the word \"adjustment\" or \"adjusting\" refers to doing a late frame long jump or pulling down the analog stick in the opposite way of the BLJ, which is always down.

Continue Dismiss https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/File:Second_count_violent_right-1.mp4     violent right twitch Types of Twitches No Twitch In this scenario, Mario can be seen moving directly back or not in any discernable direction. The speed range in which this happens is below 275 speed. There are 2 ways to adjust for this speed. Don't Adjust at all and do a late frame Long jump Add an extra long jump to the speed control stage by pulling down a medium length and long jumping again to essentially \u201creset\u201d the speed control stage, getting a second count again, and hoping to get a twitch. While the latter of the two options is more consistent, most runners opt to use the first option as it is faster. Violent Right Twitch The speed range in which this happens is ~305. This is one of the hardest situations to consistently correct for. In this situation, it looks like Mario Violently shakes to the right. This means Mario has very high speed and if there's no adjustment you will Overspeed. There is also a possibility in which Mario twitches right and then left. In this case, Mario's speed is on the lower bound of violent right twitch. You\u2019ll want to instantly pull down on the stick after recognizing this situation and possibly do a late-frame long jump to avoid Overspeed. Using a speed display for this scenario will help you get better at adjusting for this. Slow Right Twitch The speed range in which this happens is 275-290. To adjust for this speed you want to pull down for a medium amount of time . This speed reduction is closer to a No Twitch than a Violent Right Twitch. Left Twitch The speed range in which this happens is 290-305 Speed. This is the only speed range in which Mario has two different twitches. There is also a possibility that Mario twitches Left and then Right. In this case, Mario's speed is on the lower bound of left twitch. This range is the most consistent of the four possible twitches to adjust for due to its narrow speed range. You will want to adjust a medium to large amount for this speed range. (This is closer to a Violent Right twitch than a No Twitch). Exit Phase The most overlooked phase of all is the Exit Phase. This is after the Third Count and once you are confident enough with Mario's speed to set up at the Star Door. You will want to continue holding up on the analog stick until right before you're about to hit the ground. The optimal Exit is one where you hit the ground and instantly go neutral for one frame and hold left on the next frame. (Though it is not this strict). It is fine to hold neutral for a maximum of 5 frames after which, if you hold neutral for longer, you will lose all speed. Conversely, if you do not hold neutral enough, Mario will still end up at the door, but at an incorrect door position for any of the setups (although DDD Skip would still be possible), Or Mario will not have enough speed to do any of the setups. The correct door position is on this specific tile in front of the star door. DDD Skip DDD Skip now occurs when Mario is at the correct door position and has enough speed to do a setup (418-478). Mario's speed Since the use of a speed display is not allowed in RTA runs, you will need to use visual cues to figure out Mario's speed. The best, and most reliable visual cue, is the shadow that Mario produces on the tile he is standing on. based on how far left, or right, his shadow is on this tile, you can determine a speed range in which Mario is most likely to be in. Below is a list of Mario Door speeds starting at 420 and increasing by 10 until 470.  420 Speed 430 Speed 440 Speed 450 Speed 460 Speed 470 Speed Setups For any of the setups, every frame that the stick is held in one direction, mario loses 1.1 speed per frame. But every frame that the stick is held neutral for, mario loses 1.0 speed per frame. It takes 10 frames from the star door to reach the DDD painting (on average).

This setup allows you to hold straight down. Straight Down Speed Range: 425-430 Consistent Range: N/A At the door hold straight down. 8 Frame Speed Range 430-440 Consistent Range: 430-435 At the door hold down right, scroll through the text, and pause on the 8th frame of Mario's movement which is usually right behind the last pillar before the DDD Painting. After hold down and unpause. 3 Frame Speed Range 430-450 Consistent Range: 436-450 At the door hold down right, scroll through the text, and pause on the 3rd frame of Mario's movement which is usually right behind the first pillar before the hallway. After hold down and unpause. Xiah Setup Speed Range 455-464  Consistent Range: 456-462 At the door hold a slight down right angle (bias towards the down direction). Scroll through the text, and on the first frame of Mario's movement, pause and go neutral on the stick. This setup allows you to unpause, while holding neutral, and get the skip. It was also recently discovered that this setup also works for the 405-407 speed range on a different tile. Droz Setup Speed Range 457-470 Consistent Range: 459-466 At the door press c-down. Scroll through the text and right before Mario starts moving, press c-right. Exceptions There is a chance during ABLJ's where Mario will randomly lose speed despite being below the Overspeed threshold. There is currently no known way to prevent this from happening. Though it should be quite rare so if you get this exception consistently, there might be something else wrong with your technique. There is also a chance that Mario will gain enough speed from the SBLJ to skip the speed-building stage completely. You can recognize this by Mario instantly doing the two right twitches that signify exiting the speed-building stage, or by Mario doing one right twitch and a First Count twitch. Tips At any point in the ABLJ's you can do late frame long jumps to better see the twitches that happen. You can also pause the game after any twitch to give yourself more time to react.

Keep in mind that if there are any blue stars (uncollected) present in the star selection menu, then the last version that can be selected is the first blue star and not the stars after it: Version 1 : Accessed by selecting Star 1. The ship is sunken under water, and the eel will be hiding in it. Additionally, there will be fog above the water in this version. Version 2 : Accessed by selecting Star 2. The ship is floating at the surface of the water, and the eel is relocated at a hole. Bob-omb Buddy is available to talk to, allowing the cannon to be unlocked. Star 2 and 6 are also now collectable. Version 3 : Accessed by selecting Star 3 through Star 6. This is version 2, with the exception that the eel will always be swimming around, without a star on its tail. Coins Jolly Roger Bay has one of the smallest coin counts in the game, which makes the 100 coin star in this stage extra difficult. Without advanced maneuvering, it is impossible to even get 100 coins without raising the ship, and missing a single blue coin can force a player to try again. This stage also lacks any coin duplication glitches, which leaves its total max at 104.

Entering Jolly Roger Bay  (0x) Video:  \"SM64 - Castle Movement - A Presses\"   Performing a dive recover allows entering the painting without pressing A. Plunder in the Sunken Ship  (0x) Video:  \"SM64 - Plunder in the Sunken Ship - 0x A Presses\"   Due to the requirement of not pressing A, the player can only swim by pressing B with the maximum speed of 7, and therefore navigating the water requires a lot of caution. Mario can optionally pick up the shiny shell to increase swimming speed and conserve it by precise B presses. With the aid of the surface above and a ring of coins close to the ship, luring the eel out is easy. Once Mario is inside the sunken ship, the most difficult part is collecting the star in the item block without pressing A since the star is 377 units above the floor [1] . Frame-walking is required to walk up the nearby steep slopes. Then, Mario falls into the spot slightly below the item block, and ground pounds it to collect the star. Can the Eel Come Out to Play?  (0x) Video:  \"SM64 - Can the Eel Come Out to Play? - 0x A Presses\"   The star can be collected easily by swimming to the tail end of Unagi the eel, though it is slightly more difficult to do so because the swimming is much slower without pressing A. Treasure of the Ocean Cave  (0.5x) Video:  \"SM64 - Treasure of the Ocean Cave (0.5x)\" After opening the chests, Mario gains hyperspeed on a semi-submerged sloped floor through rapidly kicking, and can build enough speed to reach the star with a kick on top of the rock nearest to it. Red Coins on the Ship Afloat  (0x) Video:  \"JRB Red Coins on the Ship Afloat 0x A Presses\"   The 5 red coins outside the ship are easy to collect. The biggest problem is the 3 red coins on the ship. When the ship oscillates on water, there is a very small window where the edges of the ship can be frame-walked on as they become steep floors, instead of walls and ceilings the pushes Mario out or prevents his movement, respectively. After walking onto the ship, Mario can then collect the remaining red coins and get the star. Blast to the Stone Pillar  (0x) Video:  \"JRB Blast to the Stone Pillar 0x A Presses\"   Mario needs to reach the stone pillar platform with the item block containing the star by going off a nearby pillar. To do so, Mario needs to build and conserve enough speed to go up the pillar and cross the gap. Two major breakthroughs lead to the method of reaching the star without using an A press. The first one is having enough speed to land on the platform from the top of the pillar without pressing A. The second one is building up speed using the pillar and conserving it using  speed conservation  tricks. To generate such speed, Mario first frame-walk up the pillar and slide down into the water. Next, Mario generates the remaining speed by first restoring the speed it accumulated (via Z+C^, a speed conservation tactic), and then uses Hyper Speed Punching by standing on an ascending slope of a certain angle while punching. After punching, Mario immediately dives right back into the water to conserve the gained speed. Altogether, a maximum of 150 speed can be reached. Finally, Mario restores the conserved speed and quickly ascends the pillar and dives to the platform at the top.  Through the Jet Stream  (0x) Video:  \"SM64 - Through the Jet Stream - 0x A Presses\"   Mario needs to collect the Metal Cap to not getting pushed away by the stream. The Metal Cap is required to bypass the obstacle, as otherwise, Mario cannot swim fast enough through the stream without pressing A. To break open the Metal Cap without A presses, Mario needs to dive recover off a rock with speed and ground pound precisely. Then, Mario needs to stand at a subpixel-perfect position (x = 4979.16, z = 2481.86) to avoid getting pushed out sideways by the stream in order to collect the star in the center. JRB 100 Coins  (0x) Video:  \"JRB 100 Coins 0x A Presses\"   With only 104 coins available in Jolly Roger Bay, getting 100 of them for the Power Star requires a lot of tricks. The first trick is getting onto the ship with the aforementioned frame-walk method. This is required as there are 3 red coins on the ship, and collecting them is necessary to get the needed 100 coins. The second trick is Goomba's extended chase, in order to have a Goomba getting closer to the blue-coin block. This is required so that Mario can gain enough height to bounce on the Goomba, and then ground-pound the blue-coin block to get all blue coins. In short, Pannenkoek exploits the fact that a Goomba's target angle is recalculated while chasing Mario by either making a Goomba walk into a ledge, colliding with another Goomba, walking onto a steep slope, or bumping into a wall, thereby extending the chase further than intended  [2] . Using this method, Pannenkoek manipulates one Goomba by repeatedly making them bump into a steep slope of a rock and the wall, and then he manipulates the other Goomba to run into the same obstacles plus the previous Goomba, allowing Mario to use the Goomba to ground-pound on the blue-coin block. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge , with  Blast to the Stone Pillar  requiring precise jumps and  Through the Jet Stream  requiring efficient swimming. In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected, as they all require swimming. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , only  Treasure of the Ocean Cave  can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. The JP 1.0 version requires precise jumps to reach  Blast to the Stone Pillar . In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 1 Z press, to ground pound the  Blue Coin  block. In the  UBER Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. In the  Floor is Lava Challenge , every star except for  Treasure of the Ocean Cave  and  100 Coins  can be collected. It is possible to do a jump kick immediately when starting the level and land on a sign, then jump into the water. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: getting more coins than intended, moving during  time stop , and reaching a  Parallel Universe  from inside the sunken ship.

{"prompt": "Explain Pause Buffered Hitstun", "completion": "Pause buffering  is a technique characterized by strategically pausing to cause unusual effects during in-game (unpaused)  frames . Note that the process of pausing and unpausing in and of itself takes at least three frames, so typical pause buffering means that the game is being played at quarter-speed. Please note that pause buffering in SM64 is totally different from buffering inputs in OOT and similar games; inputs made on the pause screen cannot be carried over into the actual game. Contents 1   Applications 1.1   Pause Buffering Inputs 1.2   Pause Buffering the Global Timer 1.2.1   Pause Buffered Hitstun Applications Pause buffering can be used to press inputs on two or more in-game-contiguous frames. As  Super Mario 64  runs at 30 frames per second, a player can theoretically input a button press up to a maximum of 15 times per second. The button input needs to be released for a single frame before it can be pressed again. Pause buffering allows you to input button presses at a higher rate since the game world is frozen while inputs are still polled. These extra button presses come at the cost of time lost transitioning between the pause menu and gameplay. Pause Buffering Inputs In situations where it would be advantageous to press the same button for two frames in a row, those two in-game frames can be separated by opening the pause menu. This provides time for the game to recognize the release of the button, and be able to detect another press once the game is unpaused. In short, pausing allows an input to be released and pressed again without changing any in-game states. For example, a  dive  can be followed immediately by a  dive recover , which is useful while holding an object  handsfree  in the  A Button Challenge  (ABC). Notably, pause buffering is not necessary to perform this in a non-ABC setting, since B can be pressed to dive followed by A to recover. Pause Buffering the Global Timer The  global timer  is a variable that increments every frame, even paused frames. Thus,  objects  that depend on the global timer can be manipulated by strategically pausing. Although many objects use the global timer, the ones that are most commonly manipulated are  Swoopers  and the  Lethal Lava Land   drawbridge . Many objects use their own timer instead of the global timer, and since objects do not update while paused, cannot be affected by pause buffering. Pause Buffered Hitstun The most common use of pause buffering the global timer is Pause Buffered Hitstun, which lends itself to  HOLP  preservation and thus releasing objects remotely. The player can avoid updating the HOLP by taking advantage of  Mario 's blinking effect after  hitstun , an effect that continues if Mario is inside an enemy  hurtbox . After being hurt in any way but small fall damage, Mario, along with a held  ticket , will become transparent on every second frame. His opacity depends on the parity of the global timer, so he is not rendered on odd frames. Since the global timer is incremented on every frame, including paused frames, by pausing for the minimum three frames and unpausing for the minimum one frame when the timer is odd, Mario and the ticket will effectively not render until the blinking effect stops. Because the ticket does not need to render, the HOLP is not updated during that time. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp"}

The coin does not unload, allowing Mario to return to the shell clone and repeat the glitch. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp"}

{"prompt": "Explain Action", "completion": "An  action  is a particular state that Mario can be in.  Long jumping ,  crouching , and  walking  are examples of actions. Each action has code controlling high-level behavior such as Mario's movement while in the action, as well as transitions to other actions. Mario can only be in one action at a time. It is likely the game developers referred to actions as \"states\", as evidenced by the \"STA\" label on one of the debug menus. The name \"action\" was chosen by the community as a less ambiguous alternative. If Mario's current action is hacked to be an invalid action value, the game will either freeze or softlock, since such an action lacks associated code. There are 230 valid actions in the game, but some of these are accessible only through hacking. In addition to these, there are two \"pseudo-actions\", 0x050 and 0x051, that immediately transition to another action. Specifically, they are \"begin sliding\" actions, and they transition into either butt slide or stomach slide, depending on whether Mario is facing uphill or downhill. There is evidence of one action, action 0x00E, that was defined but whose code was never implemented. Contents 1   Action groups 2   Action flags 3   Frame 4   References Action groups An action is represented as a 32-bit value. The lowest nine bits are a unique ID for the action, ranging in value from 0x000 to 0x192. Not all action IDs in this range are used by an action. These IDs are divided into seven ranges, called action groups. These roughly categorize the behavior of each action, but are primarily used for organizational purposes in the code. Name Range start Range end Number of actions Description stationary 0x001 0x03F 36 stopped while on ground moving 0x040 0x07F 40 moving while on ground airborne 0x080 0x0BF 45 moving in air submerged 0x0C0 0x0FF 32 in water, including with metal cap cutscene 0x100 0x13F 51 no control of mario automatic 0x140 0x17F 17 restricted control of mario object 0x180 0x1BF 10 relating to picking up or releasing objects The \"uninitialized\" action with ID 0x000 is not considered to be a part of any group. Despite being a valid action, it overrides much of Mario's behavior and is implemented differently than regular actions. Action groups, while largely used for organization, do sometimes define shared properties of the actions contained in them. For example, the code for dying in quicksand is shared among the stationary, moving, and object action groups, so it is impossible to die from quicksand while in one of the other action groups. Action flags Most properties of actions are defined by action flags, which make up the remaining bits of the 32-bit action value. While there are 23 bits left after excluding the 9-bit ID, bit 30 is both unused by the game and unset by any action, so there are effectively only 22 action flags. Bit Name Example properties 9 stationary increases deceleration in water 10 moving affects buoyancy in water, push speed of horizontal wind 11 airborne allows stomping on enemies, affects knockback behavior, disallows  lava boost 12 intangible disallows object interaction 13 swimming affects knockback behavior 14 metal water affects knockback behavior, lessens gravity and terminal velocity 15 short hitbox shortens Mario's object hitbox from 160 to 100 16 riding shell makes water surface a tangible floor, allows attacking objects 17 invulnerable disables certain interactions involving damage or knockback 18 butt/stomach slide Klepto checks this flag; details not yet known 19 diving determines which picking-up action is used, affects water entry 20 on pole cannot grab pole when previous action has this flag set 21 hanging affects knockback behavior 22 idle animation plays when collecting cap, allows reading signs 23 attacking slightly affects whether an object can pick Mario up 24 interruptable by wind allows entering the vertical wind action 25 control jump height strengthens gravity when not holding A on ascent 26 allow first person allows C-up to affect action behavior 27 pause exit the level exit option is shown in the pause menu 28 swimming/flying unused by the game 29 water/text unused by the game 31 throwing something to do with particle effects; details not yet known Note that the first three flags have the same name as the first three action groups. While most actions in these groups have the corresponding flag set, the converse is typically not true. Actions in the cutscene group, for example, may have the airborne flag set if they take place while Mario is in the air. There also exist unintuitive cases, such as action 0x036,  air throw landing , which has the airborne flag set despite being a grounded stationary action, leading to strange behavior in some circumstances. [1] Frame Whenever within a frame,  execute_mario_action  is called, and Mario's action is not uninitialized (i.e. 0), the following happens: Reset Mario's model . The model animation will be updated within the action. Why is so  update_mario_inputs  so complicated? Not even going into that. Special floors: If Mario's floor type is the death plane or... vertical wind, check warps, play SOUND_MARIO_WAAAOOOW. If Mario's floor type is a warp, check warps. If Mario's floor type is the  PSS  start or end tiles, start or end the timer. If Mario's action does not have the (11) air or (13) swimming flags, the floor is SURFACE_BURNING (lava?), and Mario is not riding a shell and mario's is less than 10 units above the floor. Damage if not wearing metal cap, and set action to  Lava Boost . If Mario's floor type is null ( OOB ), exit. mario_process_interactions  ( Interact with objects ).  This can change mario's action . First, loop over every object's interaction handlers. If the interactType of the handler is one of the types Mario can currently collide with... Unset that type.  (Basically Mario cannot interact with two objects of the same interaction type.) If the object's interaction status is not INT_STATUS_INTERACTED,  call the handler Decrement the invincibility timer Call  check_kick_or_punch_wall .  (Basically, Mario still gets speed from kicking, punching, or \"tripping\" (idk what this flag name means) a wall, even if the action changes.) Remove the punching, kicking, and tripping flags from Mario. If (not interacting with door) sDisplayingDoorText = FALSE If (not interacting with warp) sJustTeleported = FALSE Loop: Call the function that executes Mario's current action . Each action has associated code as stated above. Whenever the function is called, it can return  TRUE , continuing the loop. Theoretically, there could be an infinite loop, however such a subframe transition sequence has not been found. [2] To be more accurate, each action  group  has a function. That function is called. That group-action function may do behaviour shared across all actions of the group before calling the action function. Actions often call  set_mario_action , which returns  TRUE  and processes yet another action. Beyond merely setting the action,  set_mario_action  also gives some actions various side effects. These are:  Walking ,  Hold Walking ,  Begin Sliding ,  Hold Begin Sliding ,  Double Jump ,  Backflip ,  Triple Jump ,  Flying Triple Jump ,  Water Jump ,  Hold Water Jump ,  Burning Jump ,  Riding Shell Jump ,  Jump ,  Hold Jump ,  Wall Kick Air ,  Top of Pole Jump ,  Side Flip ,  Steep Jump ,  Lava Boost ,  Dive ,  Long Jump ,  Slide Kick ,  Jump Kick ,  Metal Water Jump ,  Hold Metal Water Jump ,  Emerge From Pipe ,  Star Fall ,  Spawn Spin Airborne ,  Special Exit Airborne , and  Special Death Exit . Additionally, for all airborne actions, Mario's peak height is set to his y position, and the  MARIO_UNKNOWN_08  flag is set. Sometimes the action itself does not return the  TRUE  from this function; so it is possible for an action function to call  set_mario_action .twice, which cancels the first action (but possibly with side effects) Update Mario's model  for quicksand and squishing, adjust the  camera , when submerged adjust the camera and spawn  bubbles , update  health , update  cap  hitbox and model, process wind and infinite stairs  music . Set  oInteractionStatus  to 0. execute_mario_action  is only called by  bhv_mario_update , which after all of this is also responsible for spawning particles.

{"prompt": "Explain Super Mario 64 - Japanese", "completion": "Box art Super Mario 64  is a 1996 platforming game on the Nintendo 64 console. It was a launch title for the N64 (along with  Pilotwings 64  and  Cruis'n USA  in Europe), and is largely considered to be one of the most important 3D platformers of all time.  Contents 1   History 2   Game Versions 2.1   N64 2.1.1   Japanese 2.1.2   English 2.1.3   PAL 2.1.4   Shindou 2.2   iQue (Chinese) 2.3   64DD Version 2.4   Wii VC 2.4.1   Japanese 2.4.2   English 2.4.3   PAL 2.5   Wii U VC 2.5.1   Japanese 2.5.2   English 2.5.3   PAL 2.6   Switch 2.6.1   Super Mario 3D All-Stars 2.6.2   Nintendo Switch Online 3   Super Mario 64 DS 4   References 5   External links History Super Mario 64  started development sometime before 1995. The first time  Super Mario 64  was shown was at the  Shoshinkai show in November of 1995 , with the introduction of the Nintendo 64 (Ultra 64 at the time). Early footage of the show revealed the 50% complete beta version of  Super Mario 64 , in which it looked completely different than what the final product looked like. [1]  The final product was supposed to come out in December, but it was delayed further, and the entire game was rebuilt. On May 16th, 1996 (E3 1996) the game was shown off and is almost like the final game. [2]  The entire game was almost accessible, some details got changed before the release, such as the different star icon in the HUD, a rock spike at the top of the mountain in  Bob-omb Battlefield , and other small details that were changed. The game was rushed at the end of development as told by one of the programmers of  Super Mario 64 , and a couple of the team members never wanted to make games anymore due to being burnt out after working on  Super Mario 64 . [3]  The game was released in Japan on June 23rd 1996, then on September 29th, 1996 in North America, and finally on March 1st, 1997 in Europe. Game Versions There are many different versions of the game, differing by where, when, how, and in what way they were released. N64 The Nintendo 64 console is less robust than modern consoles, so its CPU is more likely to crash when confronted by errors and other unforeseen occurrences. Japanese The very first version of the game to be commercially released, the Japanese N64 version was succeeded by the  Shindou  version a year after release. The Japanese version has a few glitches that were later fixed in all other versions, such as  spawning displacement ,  the lack of a coin limit ,  time stop  and others. It is also notable for being the fastest version of the game for the  1 Key  category (and some others). This is because the text takes longer, but the lack of narration makes the game shorter. The text in the first Bowser fight is avoided during the 1 Key run, so the Japanese version becomes faster. English See also:  Version Differences The English version and all successive versions added some extra dialogue over the Japanese version. For example, Mario does not say \"Haha\", and Peach does not narrate her \"Dear Mario\" letter. In addition, she does not talk during the ending. It fixes some errors and glitches from the previous version, such as the lack of a coin limit. It has, in general, less text than the Japanese version, but takes longer during the intro and ending due to Peach's narration. PAL The European release of  Super Mario 64  supports language changing in the settings menu between English, French, and German. This is optimal for the  ABZ Button Challenge  because the Start button can be used to change language and the language with the least text can be selected. Due to  Wii VC Round-To-Zero , however, the true optimal PAL version is not on N64. Outside of ABZ, PAL is little-used because changing languages wastes time and English is effectively identical if you do not change languages. Because of the PAL video format using 50hz instead of NTSC's 60hz, PAL runs at 25  frames  per second rather than 30, another reason why it is suboptimal for speedruns/TASes. Shindou The final release of  Super Mario 64  on the Nintendo 64 was once again released in Japanese. It enabled a compiler flag to allow optimizations, which results in less lag. It also fixed the infamous  Backwards Long Jump  glitch, which is why it is rarely used in speedruns, except in the  BLJless  category. Strangely, when grabbing a  pole  on this version, horizontal speed affects Mario's angle. The game introduced new voice clips like \"Bye, bye!\" when throwing Bowser. Some of Mario's voice clips are high-pitched in this version. This version would later be used for Super Mario 3D All-Stars. iQue (Chinese) Main article:  Super Mario 64 (iQue) The iQue version of the game runs on the iQue Player, a rare handheld N64 variant only released in China. The iQue version is in fact the Shindou version translated to Chinese, and as such it does not have BLJs or the Bob-omb or Bully angle crashes. By hacking a romhack by Kaze onto an iQue, it was found that the camera going to a  Parallel Universe  does crash the game like on the N64 console. [4] 64DD Version Super Mario 64  DD Version or SM64DD (called Super Mario Disk Version on the title screen) was an unreleased version of the game for the 64DD, likely made to test the load times of the system. The 64DD was a commercial failure, and the DD version was never released. Only one known copy of this version exists, owned by adonfjv, who found it at a Japanese video game store in 2014 [5] . The ROM (NDD) of this version has since been dumped. SM64DD is effectively the Japanese version of SM64 ported to the 64DD, with most (but not all) sounds replaced with their PAL versions. For example, the red coin and the sliding star door sounds are the same as in the Japanese release. The title screen is vastly different, resembling the hidden debug mode's level select screen. Since it is on a disk, load times are increased. The most major difference is that entering the inside of the island in  Tiny-Huge Island , where Wiggler and red coins reside, will crash the game. This makes collecting all 120 stars impossible on this version. The crash is console only, and occurs due to Wiggler's health value being uninitialized (the original Japanese and USA releases do not crash from this programming oversight as a coincidence). Wii VC Main article:  Virtual Console The Wii acts differently from the N64. It is much less likely to crash. Unlike the N64, it does not crash from  PU crashes ,   Bully angle crash , or Bob-omb angle crash. The emulation software also  rounds floats differently  from other consoles. Another difference is that it does not crash from the  Address Error Exception . It is currently unknown whether the Wii crashes upon having infinity speed. Japanese Japanese Wii VC is actually the Shindou edition, not the original Japanese version. This is why it does not have spawning displacement or other Japanese N64-exclusive glitches, nor does it have BLJs. It is almost never used for speedrunning for that reason. English English Wii VC is the optimal Wii VC for speedruns. It avoids the lack of BLJs in the Japanese version and the slower framerate of the PAL version. It is used for the  A Button Challenge  any% run because  Bowser in the Fire Sea  takes 0 A presses instead of 1 due to a rounding error. PAL PAL Wii VC is rarely seen because it is obscure and slow. However, it is actually the ideal game version for the ABZ Button Challenge, at least for any%, because it contains both language switching and the rounding error in BitFS. Wii U VC Main article:  Virtual Console The Wii U Virtual Console version has no known interesting glitches that set it apart from either N64 or Wii VC. It is identical to Wii VC, except that the rounding error is absent. Like Wii VC, it ignores  Address Error Exceptions . Wii U VC is often joked by speedrunners for have a high amount of input lag and it is mostly used only by new runners. Japanese Much like Wii VC, Japanese Wii U VC is the Shindou version. This means that BLJs and other glitches that were patched in the Shindou version are absent.  English Also like Wii VC, American Wii U VC is the US version. PAL PAL Wii U VC is actually the US version (unlike on Wii VC), so it's identical to the US Wii U VC. [6] Switch Super Mario 3D All-Stars Super Mario 3D All-Stars  includes an upscaled  Super Mario 64 . The version is the Shindou version with Lua scripts to hack in English text, new upscaled textures, and slight changes to accommodate the Switch control scheme (for example, \"PRESS +\" on the Mario head screen instead of \"PRESS START\"). [7]  The Switch does not have  the Wii's rounding error , but it does ignore  Address Error Exceptions . Nintendo Switch Online Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack includes  Super Mario 64  as part of the Nintendo 64 emulated games. Unlike  Super Mario 3D All-Stars , the Nintendo Switch Online version still has BLJs. [8] Super Mario 64 DS Main article:  Super Mario 64 DS Super Mario 64 DS  is a remake of  Super Mario 64  for the DS. Its physics are vastly different and there is no evidence that it shares any code with the original N64 release but may very likely have used the original N64 models for levels and areas; therefore it is not usually considered a \"version\" of  Super Mario 64 , but rather a rerelease. It has 150 stars instead of the original's 120, more powerups, different playable characters with different special abilities, and more.

{"prompt": "Explain Low Doors Challenge", "completion": "A  Challenge  is a self-imposed restriction of performing certain tasks, making the completion of the game harder. Restrictions include the use of a certain button (the  A Button , for example), the use of cannons, collecting coins, and the use of caps, among others. Often, these challenges lead to the discovery of glitches, while some must be utilized to make up for a loss of a certain function. For example, restricting the A button forces Mario to use techniques such as frame-walking, enemy manipulation, and  cloning  to complete certain tasks. Collecting the 5 secrets in Bob-omb Battlefield coinless requires making a  Premature Clone  of the top coin and landing at the 30-unit high area to collect the secret without interacting with the center coin. Contents 1   UBER Challenge 2   Pacifist Challenge 3   A Button Challenge 4   Coinless Challenge 5   Cannonless Challenge 6   Capless/Cannonless Challenge 7   CCC Challenge 8   No Buttons Allowed/Buttonless Challenge 9   ABZ Challenge 10   Low Doors Challenge 11   No Joystick Allowed Challenge 12   Floor is Lava Challenge 13   Joke Challenges 14   Other challenges 15   References UBER Challenge Main article:  UBER Challenge The UBER Challenge forbids any coins and  collectibles  (except chests), switches, cannons, teleporting, caps, opening boxes (except for star boxes), damage (except falling), and activating movable platforms. Additionally, enemies must not be interacted with (including Lakitu, but excluding Bowser and MIPS). The challenge was created by Mario64Masters. The name of the UBER Challenge was borrowed from Manocheese's \u00dcber Challenge for Ocarina of Time. There are 39 stars that can be collected RTA, and 46 stars are possible in a TAS run. Pacifist Challenge Main article:  Pacifist Challenge The Pacifist Challenge forbids any combat with enemies except for Bowser. Any actions that do not result in killing an enemy are allowed. The number of stars that can be collected is 98 glitchless, and 101 for TAS runs [1] . In a full game run, however, killing the Boo to enter  Big Boo's Haunt  is considered nonpacifist, cutting off the available 2 stars, and therefore the actual number of stars that can be collected is 96 glitchless and 99 with TAS. The following stars cannot be collected in the RTA pacifist run. BoB  (2):  Big Bob-omb on the Summit  (enemy),  Footrace with Koopa The Quick  (requires the previous star) WF  (2):  Chip Off Whomp's Block  (enemy),  To the Top of the Fortress  (requires the previous star) BBH  (7): All stars are cut off due to entering the course requiring killing a Boo. If entering the stage is allowed, then only two stars ( Secret of the Haunted Books  and  Seek the 8 Red Coins ) can be collected. HMC  (1):  HMC 100 coins  (only 92 non-enemy coins) LLL  (2):  Boil the Big Bully  (enemy),  Bully the Bullies  (enemy) SSL  (1):  Stand Tall on the Four Pillars  (enemy) SL  (1):  Chill with the Bully  (enemy), THI  (4):  Pluck the Piranha Flower  (enemy),  Rematch with Koopa the Quick  (requiring Star 1),  Make Wiggler Squirm (enemy) ,  THI 100 coins  (infinite coin glitch requires killing Piranhas) The following stars can be circumvented if glitches or TAS strategies are allowed: WF  -  Blast Away the Wall : A wall clip can be performed to reach the star cannonless. SSL  -  SSL 100 coins : 100 coins can be collected using infinite coin glitch, done by disappearing cork box glitch in the course. 86 non-enemy coins otherwise. SL  -  SL 100 coins : 100 coins can be collected with an infinite coin glitch, by activating  Time Stop  from the snowman and repeatedly collecting a nearby coin. 58 non-enemy coins otherwise. A Button Challenge Main article:  A Button Challenge The A Button Challenge aims to reduce the use of  A Button  in courses, first documented in  Curtis Bright's website . Since then, many techniques are applied in an attempt to bring down the A Press count, with  pannenkoek2012  being the biggest contributor to the challenge. There are 98 stars that can be collected on a full game basis without the A Button using TAS. A 120-star run of the game can be completed in 13. Coinless Challenge The Coinless Challenge's only rule is that the player cannot collect any coins. Specifically, no yellow, red, or blue coins can be collected. Techniques where Mario's coin score is saved as 0 coins by collecting multiples of 256, or pause buffering to prevent the coin counter from going up, are not allowed. Mario is able to collect 81 stars in a full game run, and 82 stars on a single star basis. The remaining 38 stars require collecting coins and are therefore impossible. Cannonless Challenge In the Cannonless Challenge, entering any cannons is forbidden. As it turns out, all 120 stars can be collected cannonless. The challenge was completed on 23 July 2018 by sm64expert, when he collected the  Wing Mario Over the Rainbow Red Coin Star . [2] Capless/Cannonless Challenge To qualify as capless, Mario cannot use any special caps except the cap effects obtained from the start of a course. To qualify as cannonless, Mario cannot use any cannons. Using the capless and cannonless ruleset from the UBER Challenge, every star except for one ( Wing Mario Over the Rainbow Red Coin Star ) can be collected, resulting 119 stars that can be collected. The most difficult stars to collect include: BoB  -  Shoot to the Island in the Sky ,  100 Coins ,  Find the 8 Red Coins : Going to the island can be done by long jumping from the top of the mountain. SSL  -  Free Flying for 8 Red Coins : Tornadoes, Fly Guys, and Klepto can help Mario collect the 4 aerial coins without the wing cap. Vanish Cap under the Moat : The cage can be reached by performing a side flip to a wall kick, removing the need of using a vanish cap. CCC Challenge Main article:  CCC Challenge The CCC Challenge combines Coinless with Capless/Cannonless. The restriction is extremely heavy, leaving very few stars that can be collected, as some of them inadvertently collect coins during the process. Mario is able to collect 81 stars in a full game run, and 82 stars on a single star basis. While this is the same number of stars collectible as Coinless Challenge, the workarounds are much harder to achieve. No Buttons Allowed/Buttonless Challenge Main article:  No Buttons Allowed Challenge The No Buttons Allowed Challenge forbids the use of A, B, Z, Start, L, R, and (to some extent) C buttons. This challenge was created by pannenkoek2012 to push the game to its limits. The C buttons are only allowed when they only affect the camera and don't affect actual gameplay. For example, the  C^ Hyperspeed  glitch is not allowed. The challenge is more difficult than simply restricting the A button, since this disables many maneuvering options that Mario can use, such as jumping, diving, sliding, and more. The challenge cannot be done as a full game run as there is in-game text that cannot be advanced without the use of buttons. There are only 34 stars that can be collected, many of which require complicated strategies. [3] ABZ Challenge Main article:  ABZ Button Challenge The ABZ Challenge is similar to Buttonless, but instead of restricting all buttons only restricts the three primary buttons, A B and Z. Instead of requiring that they don't be used at all, it allows simply using the minimum number of buttons possible. It was as an alternative to the Buttonless Challenge, since the Buttonless Challenge did not allow the start button, and consequently did not allow changing languages on PAL version to minimize text box button presses. Low Doors Challenge In the Low Doors Challenge, the game must be beaten while opening as few doors as possible. A door is considered used when the door opening cutscene occurs. Doors are skipped using BLJs and HSWKs, pause exiting, and routing to avoid moving between castle floors unnecessarily. Any% needs to open only 2 doors to complete: one door to enter the basement (using either the key door or moat door), and one door to enter the upper floors. 120 Stars needs to open 4 doors to complete: one to enter the basement (using either the key door or moat door), one to enter the upper floors, one to enter the courtyard for BBH, and one to exit the CCM slide level through the cabin. Unconfirmed door skips exist in BBH, HMC, and skipping the door to the endless stairs using HSWKs. The 50 star door stairs BLJ cannot be used for the latter, as Mario needs to stop at the 3rd floor to get all stars, and cannot pause exit out from the 3rd floor. No Joystick Allowed Challenge Main article:  No Joystick Allowed Challenge The No Joystick Allowed Challenge forbids the use of Joystick inputs, considered to be the inverse of No Buttons Allowed Challenge. As the joystick provides the vital function for Mario to change directions and run, the challenge takes route planning to the extreme. The challenge can only be done on a single star basis and not a full game run due to absurd limitations. There are only 55 stars that can be collected, many of which require complicated strategies. A related challenge is the  Low Joystick Magnitude Challenge , in which the joystick is allowed but the magnitude of the joystick is to be minimized. The value to be minimized can be either the largest joystick magnitude needed in a run or segment, or the total magnitude value integrated over the whole run. Floor is Lava Challenge The  Floor is Lava Challenge  disallows standing on floors that aren't part of objects. It was created by Timestoppa. Joke Challenges Some challenges have been created as jokes, and then actually been executed, such as Plush% (collecting specific stars to make the  STROOP  file menu spell out \"PLUSH\"). Another joke challenge: \"prove for as many actions as possible that they can transition into  Eaten By Bubba  in vanilla\". [4] Other challenges The  Same Input Challenge  is a challenge where the goal is to collect as many stars as possible using the same sequence of inputs. Many other smaller challenges exist, with the goal not always being to collect a star. See  Unsolved Single-Goal Challenges  for single-goal challenges that have not been solved.

{"prompt": "Explain Platform Differences", "completion": "The primary differences between the platforms comes down to lag, loading and level of competition.  For a more detailed listing of version differences, including regional differences, check out the  Game Versions  page. If you're a beginner, starting out on Emulator is recommended because it's the easiest to get into and requires least amount of investment.  However, if you plan on taking the game more seriously, the majority of the top competition across all categories is on the original console, N64.  Virtual Console is a less popular option, but is still available for play and submission to the leaderboards.

{"prompt": "Explain Coinless Challenge", "completion": "Coinless Challenge Individual stars collectible 82 Overall stars collectible 81 Is beatable Yes Star Details BoB WF JRB CCM BBH HMC LLL SSL DDD SL WDW TTM THI TTC RR Secret Castle Bowser The objective of the  coinless challenge  is to get as many  Power Stars  in Super Mario 64 as possible while collecting no coins. The use of frame perfect pausing to delay the coin counter going up or using a multiple of 256 to save the coin score as zero does not count as coinless. Stars All Power Stars that are not 100 Coin Stars or Red Coin Stars are obtainable in this challenge except for the case of  Snowman's Lost His Head  which is obtainable on a single star basis, but not a full game run. This is because you need to complete the star  Frosty Slide for 8 Red Coins  before you can select the Snowman's Lost His Head star and that is the only star the snowman spawns on. Stars that require non-trivial workarounds include: CCM  -  Slip Slidin' Away  and  Big Penguin Race : Mario can use the baby penguin to clip through the mountain to reach the cabin from the side, avoiding the coins near the entrance. An alternative, RTA viable method is to have Mario dive between a rock and floor to clip through the mountain. [1] SSL  -  Pyramid Puzzle : Mario can collect the secrets without touching their coins by only touching the very top of the secret's hitbox. BoB  -  Behind Chain Chomp's Gate : Performing a Bob-omb clip allows Mario to go behind the gate without releasing the Chain Chomp, where a red coin would be inadvertently collected. There is also one workaround that is TAS only: BoB  -  Mario Wings to the Sky :  PU movement  can be used to reach the first 4 secrets before the coins near them become tangible. Premature cloning can then be used to render one of the coins near the 5th secret inert so Mario can enter the secret's hitbox without entering the hitbox of a coin.

Press C-Down and C-Left upon entering the stage, hold straight left, jump and kick to land next to the slope's edge, then perform a triple-jump dive over the hill. Landing closer to the slope before the double jump makes it easier to land on the back of the hill after the triple-jump dive, allowing Mario to gain more speed before sliding off, thus saving more time.

The maximum coin count that can be achieved in the castle in 999, by either exiting a level after getting 999 coins, or repeatedly collecting Castle coins and going out of the area and back in to respawn them. This list enumerates the unique coins that can be collected in the castle. Location Count (Outside the Castle) 2 yellow coins hidden underneath the bridge over moat 2 Total 2 Location Count (Inside the Castle) In the main entrance room, 2 pairs of coins beside the staircase 4 Total 4 Location Count (Castle Courtyard) 9 Boo Buddies (with yellow coins) 9 Total 9 Areas Castle Grounds The castle grounds are the starting location when creating a new file, loading a previous file, or dying anywhere within the castle. It features a sunny environment with birds and water sound effects in the background. There is also a cannon next to the lake that unlocks at 120 stars, which is meant to allow you to get onto the castle roof. However, it can be bypassed with precise movement. On the roof, if you have 120 stars,  Yoshi  tries to maximize Mario's lives to 100. There is one secret stage on the castle grounds,  Vanish Cap Under the Moat , which is usually entered by draining the most but can be entered by hyperspeed. Castle Lobby First Floor The first floor is the introductory area of the castle. It contains 4 main courses ( Bob-omb Battlefield ,  Whomp's Fortress ,  Cool, Cool Mountain , and  Jolly Roger Bay ), and three secret courses ( The Princess's Secret Slide ,  The Secret Aquarium , and  Tower of the Wing Cap ). The star door on this floor requires 8 stars to open and leads to  Bowser in the Dark World , the first Bowser stage. The door can be skipped with an  LBLJ , by  HSWKing , or with speed conserved from  Bob-omb Battlefield . [1] [2]  Additionally, there is a key door to the second floor, as well as one leading to the basement (the intended next area) and a regular warp door leading into the courtyard. Basement The basement has 4 main courses ( Shifting Sand Land ,  Lethal Lava Land ,  Hazy Maze Cave , and  Dire, Dire Docks ). It also contains the pillars normally required to unlock  Vanish Cap Under the Moat , although they can be bypassed with moat door skip. The star door in this area requires 30 stars which can be skipped with an  SBLJ , and leads to the second Bowser stage,  Bowser in the Fire Sea , and Dire, Dire Docks. Second Floor Just like the others, the second floor has 4 main courses ( Tall, Tall Mountain ,  Wet Dry World ,  Snowman's Land  and  Tiny-Huge Island ), along with a star door that requires 50 stars to enter, which leads to the third floor. The door can be skipped using  BLJs  or  HSWKing . Third Floor The third floor contains 2 main courses,  Tick Tock Clock  and  Rainbow Ride , along with one secret stage,  Wing Mario over the Rainbow . Although there are \"endless\" stairs on this floor that require 70 stars to pass, they can easily be skipped using  BLJs . These stairs lead to the final Bowser stage,  Bowser in the Sky . Courtyard The courtyard is the location of  Big Boo's Haunt , whose entrance is hidden inside the  Courtyard Big Boo . There are 9 other regular Boos in the Courtyard, spawned by  Courtyard Boo Spawners . If the player has less than 12 stars, the regular Boos do not spawn, and the Big Boo spawns but immediately despawns itself. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge ,  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , and  CCC Challenge , all stars and stage entries are possible. The Castle provides a huge roadblock for the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge  and  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , as doors and high paintings block most stage entries in those challenges. None of the five stars within the castle can be collected in either challenge. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all five stars can be collected. All stages can be entered with the exception of  Big Boo's Haunt , which requires killing a  Boo  to enter. In the  B Button Challenge , the Castle requires two B presses to grab  MIPS  both times, as well as an additional three B presses on the JP 1.0 version to talk to the three  Toads . All stages can be entered. In the  Z Button Challenge , all stars and stage entries are possible. Entering  Vanish Cap under the Moat  requires PU movement to skip pounding the two pillars. In the  UBER Challenge , the first MIPS star can be collected, as MIPS is an exception to the UBER Challenge rules. The second MIPS star cannot be collected as there are not enough possible stars to unlock it.  Big Boo's Haunt  cannot be entered, as it requires killing a Boo.  Whomp's Fortress  also cannot be entered, as  Lakitu  talks to Mario when entering the course. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in the Castle: reaching a  Parallel Universe  in the basement, upstairs, or courtyard, hanging below the entrance bridge with the water raised, and accessing the upper floors without collecting the key from Bowser.

{"prompt": "Explain 10k glitch", "completion": "This article is in need of changes to meet Ukikipedia quality standards. This page is most likely lacking information or may contain inaccuracies.  You can help fix it . The  discussion page  may contain suggestions. The  10k glitch  is a glitch that exploits how the game physics tries to slow Mario down when Mario is sliding forward and the player tilts the joystick backwards. For example, on a default friction floor type, Mario's speed is multiplied by .92 + (.01+v/10,000)cos(DYaw), where v is the speed units Mario has. DYaw is the difference in angle between where Mario is facing and joystick tilt, thus cos(dyaw) is always negative. The slowing effect is stronger if Mario is faster. If Mario has 9100 speed, he will immediately stop in place. But past that, Mario's speed can be instantly reflected into small backward speed, and once he has more than 20k speed, Mario's speed can even multiply by several factors. At 90k speed, Mario's speed is scaled by -8 into -720k speed. And at 262k speed, his speed is scaled by -261 into -69.4 million speed. Execution To perform the 10k glitch, Mario must be in a braking state (holding backwards on the analog stick as if he were about to sideflip) with high forward speed (at least 20k) and then touch a  slippery slope . Since most  courses  are too small to attain this much speed while touching such a slope, this glitch is typically performed using  PU speed . v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp"}

See the table at the bottom of the page for an overview of each strat. Entering the Volcano Beginner Movement - Mario cam on entry and delay the C-Down to make sure your camera is directly behind you. Switch to lakitu cam after the 2nd long jump to set up the cam for the 3rd. This movement is good for when you're starting out, but most players move to either of the intermediate options fairly early. Intermediate Movement - These options are for intermediate players and above. Which you choose is a matter of preference. Both begin with a C-Left followed by Mario Cam and C-Down. Hold A before after the camera inputs to allow you to buffer a kick once you have control of Mario. For the Mario Cam option, stay in Mario cam the whole time while pressing C-Right to adjust the camera. For the Lakitu Cam version, switch to Lakitu Cam during the first long jump, then input one C-Right when you land. Load video Local File Local File might collect personal data.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Snowman's Land)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way. No Joystick Allowed The 100 coin star is currently used to reset Mario's ascent of steep slopes, which is useful near the top of the pyramid in  Shifting Sand Land  to collect the stars  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  and  Pyramid Puzzle .

Contents 1   \u2192 Setup Guide 2   Versions 2.1   NTSC-J 2.2   NTSC-U 2.3   PAL 2.4   NTSC-J Shindou Edition 3   Lag Reduction 4   Controllers 4.1   OEM Nintendo 64 Controller 4.2   Hori Minipad 4.3   GameCube Controller 4.4   Other Third Party Controllers \u2192 Setup Guide The  N64  buying guide covers everything you need to know to get set up to play on console, including information on game versions, platforms, TVs, monitors, and peripherals like input displays and Everdrives. Versions There are 4 versions of Super Mario 64 that were released on the Nintendo 64. All runs performed on Nintendo 64 must use an official cartridge of one of these releases of Super Mario 64. Submitting runs played on a flashcart or Everdrive is against the official leaderboard rules. NTSC-J This is the first Japanese release. This version has a shorter intro cutscene, less text overall, and small differences in a few stages. it is faster for 1 Star, 16 Star, and 120 Star NTSC-U This is the North American release. Text boxes scroll faster and 15 star MIPS runs slower in this release. It is faster for 0 Star and 70 Star PAL This is the European/Australian release. It only runs at 25 fps, which makes it completely unsuitable for speedrunning. NTSC-J Shindou Edition This is the updated Japanese release that includes support for the Rumble Pak. This version has removed the ability to perform BLJs, so 0 star, 1 star and 16 star cannot be completed. It also longer loading times than NTSC-U and NTSC-J, and slightly less lag in some sections. This version is only faster in some single star records, but in a full game run it's best to be avoided. Lag Reduction The Nintendo 64 console often lags quite a bit while running Super Mario 64. Speedrunners use a myriad of techniques to reduce as much lag as possible while performing their movement. This mostly consists of turning the camera to face a specific way to reduce the workload of the N64 graphics processor.  You can find more information about Lag Reduction at the  Usamune Project Lag Library . Lag Reduction tips are also sprinkled into the RTA Guides. Controllers   Top: GameCube controller. Bottom Left: OEM Nintendo 64 controller. Bottom Right: Hori Minipad There are a variety of controllers that can be used on a Nintendo 64. Here we will list them out and briefly describe the pros and cons of each. OEM Nintendo 64 Controller This is the controller that the majority of runners use. This controller was designed by Nintendo specifically for this game so you won't find anything more suitable. It has an analog stick with an octagonal gate and most setups on the RTA guide are calibrated around these angles due to the popularity of the controller.  That being said, there are some major drawbacks to using this controller, the most significant of which being the analog stick, which is notorious for wearing out extremely quickly. For this reason, runners seek out controllers with high quality sticks and attempt to keep them in as good of a condition as possible by lubricating them with synthetic silicone based lubricants (never oil based) and by using a secondary controller for throwing Bowser, as spinning the analog stick is the fastest way to wear it out. Runners will also source aftermarket solutions to make the stick more durable, commonly a steel bowl from companies like Steelsticks64 are put into the controller to prevent it from wearing out. There is a whole slew of aftermarket stick solutions out there to solve this problem and new solutions are popping up all the time. If you do have a high quality stick, you will be treated to some of the finest control of Mario that's available. Another subjective drawback is the issue of comfort in the hands. Some people dislike the N64 controller because of its signature tri-wing design being a bit too cramped.  Hori Minipad The Hori Minipad is a third party controller that was released exclusively in Japan in the latter part of the N64's lifecycle. It is most notable for having a Gamecube style stick which will not wear out nearly as quickly, and it only has 2 prongs which brings it closer in line with the design of modern controllers.  There are a few commonly cited drawbacks to this controller, the first of which being the stick sensitivity and angle inconsistency. It can be rather difficult to find a Minipad with a stick that has good angles for speedrunning, and getting a dud can be incredibly costly since these controllers usually sell for upwards of $80 USD. The sensitivity on the stick can also make precise adjustments more difficult than the OEM N64 Controller. The second issue is that of comfort. The Minipad, as its name implies, is incredibly compact. The layout is incredibly crowded and some people may find it uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time. Finally, the buttons on the Minipad can feel a bit unsatisfying to use. The triggers especially can feel a bit spongy with a shallow actuation distance, and the presence of two small trigger buttons in the same spot with no proper separation can be weird to new users.  GameCube Controller Though less popular than the other two, the GameCube controller can be used on an N64 console through the use of an adapter made by Raphnet. At first glance this controller seems to be the best choice, having a very high quality stick that won't wear out which is also far more comfortable than the others. It is also easy to get your hands on a new one since Nintendo has re-released this controller for Smash 4 and Smash Ultimate.  These conveniences, however, come with some caveats. The major issue is that there are no C-Buttons, instead there is a C-Stick which maps to digital C-Button presses. This makes it quite a bit harder to operate during the run, making some advanced lag reductions more difficult to perform. This issue can be partially mitigated by double binding your C-Right and C-Left Buttons to both the C-Stick and to the X and Y buttons, which is a feature of the Raphnet adapter.  Another common gripe is that using the GameCube controller's analog L button is uncomfortable or inconsistent when mapped to the N64's Z button. This can be mitigated by ensuring that Z is bound to the digital press at the bottom of the L button and not the analog portion of the press. If you experience discomfort from pressing the analog L button all the way every time, then you can remove the spring in the trigger or use trigger plugs to reduce the actuation distance.  Finally, the stick on the GameCube controller has the same issue as the Hori Minipad, that being high sensitivity and angles that are different from the N64. This isn't necessarily a downside, as the different angles can make some strats easier and others more difficult to perform. Other Third Party Controllers There are a myriad of other lower quality controllers out there for the N64. Some of these controllers are usable in certain contexts, but most of them are a complete waste of money and should be avoided at all costs. Controllers like the Retrobit Tribute64 and the Brawler64 are suitable to be used as secondary Bowser throw controllers, but it is recommended not to use them for general gameplay due to their cheaper build quality, poor stick angles and sensitivity. Other unbranded controllers that look like N64 controllers should also be avoided as their sticks and overall build quality is incredibly poor and will not be consistent at all. This also includes controllers from the N64 era, such as the SuperPad64 or the Boomerang 64 v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e RTA Guide Platforms Nintendo 64  \u2022  Virtual Console  \u2022  Emulator Categories 0/1 Star  \u2022  16 Star  \u2022  70 Star  \u2022  120 Star  \u2022  31 Star  \u2022  50 Star  \u2022  All\u00a0!

Castle Lobby Mario kicks and then  long jumps  towards the stairs on the left and performs a  pause buffered   BLJ  on them to reach  Cool, Cool Mountain  almost immediately, bypassing and clipping through the 3 star door. Cool Cool Mountain Wall Kicks Will Work   The seam in the level geometry Mario falls down, more clearly highlighted. Mario jumps very precisely into a seam in the level geometry near the start of the course to immediately fall down to the star, and kicks off the wall near the  star  with downwards velocity, collecting it. Slip Slidin' Away Mario immediately  triple jumps  into the cabin. He then long jumps to the right of the slide and immediately falls down to the lowest outside part. At the bottom, Mario dives uphill just before reaching it to avoid fall damage, and his backwards speed is directed towards the door, opening it. Outside the cabin, Mario finally long jumps towards the star and collects it. 100 Coins & Big Penguin Race Mario first slide kicks towards a five-coin line directly below him and collects it, while performing dives, jump dives, kicks and recovers to keep speed inclined uphill while collecting the remaining coins up towards the cabin again. He then kills the spindrift and collects the five coins placed above the cabin while entering it, giving him a total of 23 coins. Inside the cabin, Mario races the penguin, keeping speed while also collecting coins and manipulating the penguins rubber-band AI to stay just behind him at all times. After he collects the final coin on the slide (as there are 77 in total inside the cabin), the  100 coin star  spawns just before the exit. Mario  wall kicks  the wall in front of him to redirect his speed towards the star and collects it just as the penguin finishes the race, which also saves time with the 3 star text box. Mario then waits for a short while for the penguin to talk to him and finally collects the star. Frosty Slide For 8 Red Coins Mario first goes to the tree near the beginning and performs a  side flip  to collect the first  red coin  on top. He then falls a long distance and collects a much lower red coin while sliding towards the red coin at the top of the lift. After this, Mario slides down a slope to double jump high enough to reach the red coin on the tree near the cabin exit, then performs a  glitchy wall kick  near the cabin to conserve this speed further. Mario then collects the next two red coins at the bottom and enters the  warp  back to the top, and slides down to collect the red coin below the warp, immediately wall kicking off of its nearby wall and sliding down to collect the final red coin, spawning the star. Finally, Mario lands from sliding and performs a kick to conserve speed from it to reach the star and collect it. Lil Penguin Lost Mario triple jumps up to the penguin, grabs him and immediately slides all the way to the bottom of the course and performs a jump at the end of the slide to reach the penguin's mother. (as a kick cannot be performed while holding him) Mario then collects the star spawned from this event. Snowman's Lost his Head Mario long jumps towards and then jumps up to the snowman head, triggering the star event. Mario then slides towards a tree and jumps from it, going around the course while reaching the snowman's base in just enough time; and collects the star. Castle Lobby (2) Mario performs a  side BLJ  on the ramp to his right, to bypass various walls and doors to enter the Princess' Secret Slide Princess' Secret Slide under 21 Seconds Mario long jumps towards the slide and then bounces off of the wall on his right, making him slide backwards. This is then corrected by another wall bounce, which is used to jump to the end of the slide where Mario dives facing uphill, and completes the slide with a time of 12.3 seconds, spawning the under 21 seconds star. Mario leaves the slide and then dive recovers into the star. Castle Lobby (3) Mario performs a BLJ on the stairs to his left to enter BitDW without activating the star door. Bowser in the Dark World (with red coins) Mario long jumps towards the block switch and activates it, doing  dives  and  dive recovers  back to the red coin by the block. Mario then goes back to collect the second red coin on the other switch activated block and triple jumps up to a wall near the first rotating platforms and kicks off of it. On this, Mario does a BLJ while the platform is rising, rapidly moving around and collecting most of the other red coins in the course; except for a higher one which he side flips and wall kicks up to. From here, Mario dives and recovers towards the star,  dive grinding  up the ramp without activating the steps; before entering the pipe to fight Bowser for the first time. Bowser Fight Mario jumps over Bowser and grabs his tail, swinging him once into a mine, defeating him and collecting his key. Castle Lobby (4) Outside of BitDW, Mario side BLJs on the stairs behind him and goes to PSS. Princess' Secret Slide This is performed the same as the under 21 seconds star at first, with the exception of the dive recover at end being angled around the star spawned from this. Mario then jumps and begins a  ground pound  to break the box, spawn the star, and immediately fall down with the star as soon as the cutscene ends. (as his ground pound hitbox is inside the star) Castle Lobby (5) Mario looks up at the ceiling and enters TotWC, performing a stationary slide kick before the fadeout ends. Tower of the Wing Cap Mario flies down to collect the two lowest red coins, then upwards to collect the rest in sequence. After the star is spawned, Mario flies just above the  wing cap  switch, activating it and then flying into the star, skipping the text box. Castle Lobby (6) This time, Mario BLJs on the stairs to the right, to enter Whomp's Fortress. Whomp's Fortress Blast Away the Wall Mario first long jumps towards a wall underneath the water on the elevated platform to the right of his spawn point and GWKs using the adjacent corner to get up. He then uses a nearby almost vertical steep slope to his left on the ramp to cut a corner and jump towards, then dive up to the falling block platforms, and dive recovering towards the star. Mario instantly collects this star cannonless, as Mario can grab onto a ledge near the star for one frame, placing his hitbox inside of it and immediately  downwarping  him, (as the wall pushes him out) also cutting the star music short due to piranha plant lullaby. Fall into the Caged Island Mario performs the same GWK as the previous star up to the ramp, then performing dive/dive recovers up it and wall kicking off of the wall near the top of the course, landing him on a floating isle. On here, Mario does a side flip and wall kicks off of the star cage, landing him inside it (while dive bonking towards an inside wall to save a short amount of time) and collecting the star. 100 Coins & Red Coins on the Floating Isle Mario collects the first five coins and the first red coin by the push blocks, then collecting the five coins on the ramp and eight coins in the water, and dive jumping up to the second red coin below the spinning platform from a long jump. Mario then collects the five red coins near the  cannon  and activates the blue block switch, throwing the cork box while collecting its coins with the last two blue coins spawned from the switch, wall kicking and jumping above the Shoot Into the Wild Blue star and collecting the eight coins at the top of its nearby  pole . Using a nearby almost vertical slope, Mario triple jumps up to the spinning platform and long jumps towards his third red coin and collects the others surrounding it, first-frame wall kicking twice aiming towards the five coins on the wooden board nearby, also spawning a  1-Up Mushroom . After this, Mario uses the slope behind the fence to get a small amount of extra speed and triple jump off of the  thwomp , collecting the fourth red coin and eight coins on the floating platform above, then collecting the fifth red coin near the arrow-shaped platform along with the coins on it and long jumping towards the sixth red coin. On the way down, Mario kills a piranha plant with a dive and collecting the seventh red coin, waiting for the death animation to finish to collect both its blue coin and eighth red coin on the same frame, skipping the red coin cutscene and spawning both the 100 coin and red coin stars. Once the 100 coin star is spawned, Mario collects it with a ground pound, and then uses the nearby slope to slide down and jump towards the red coin star to collect it. Chip Off Whomp's Block The route starts identical to Blast Away the wall, although once Mario reaches the steep slope by the falling blocks he begins to do kicks up it, and once he reaches the top, he performs a side flip into a wall below King Whomp and a GWK using the nearby wall, diving up to him. Mario then ground pounds on him three times by clipping through him during its animation while he falls, and performs a dive just before the star spawns, allowing him to fall down and collect it immediately. To the Top of the Fortress Until the fortress itself is reached, the route is almost the same as the previous star, except Mario does not dive after the GWK, instead triple jumping afterwards with the help of one of the fortress' platforms and doing another GWK to reach the very top, grabbing onto its ledge. Finally, Mario punches and long jumps into the star to collect it. Shoot Into the Wild Blue Instead of doing a GWK up to the platform directly above mario, he performs a pause-buffered BLJ into the ramp next to the first piranha plant. Mario hits the wall behind him for one long jump, but is then  upwarped  by the water behind him, and he continues to use backwards speed until he is under the star and punches to stop. He finally side flips into the nearby wall and kicks off of it into the star. Castle Lobby (7) Mario goes to the small set of stairs near the painting rooms door and does a side BLJ on them to quickly go to  Bob-omb Battlefield . Bob-Omb Battlefield Find the 8 Red Coins Mario jumps up the slope to the right of him and dives down it, facing the wing cap block and conserving speed towards it with kicks and slide kicks, wall kicking off of the wall in front of it and collecting the wing cap inside. Mario then wall kicks up to the first red coin with a backwards side flip and BLJs on the elevator below. From this, Mario directs himself backwards to collect the second and third red coins, redirecting his speed with a tree, and triple jumping towards  Out of Bounds  to redirect speed with the wing cap. While  Hyperspeed Flying , Mario collects the red coins by the summit and on the island in the sky, while clipping through the switch gate at the bottom of the course with enough speed and collecting its red coin. In front of the gate, Mario quickly triple jumps on the slope and bounces off of the wall ahead, redirecting speed again towards the final red coin, where he dives and recovers into the ground to collect it and spawn the star. Mario Wings to the Sky Mario collects the wing cap with the same route as the last star, although reaching the elevator without collecting its red coin. Again, mario BLJs from this elevator, but aims towards the tree behind it, grabbing it for one frame to immediately redirect speed and quickly triple jump up the steep slope of the nearby cannon, bouncing of of OoB to fly through the five secrets in fast succession. The star then spawns, and mario flies down to collect it. Big Bob-omb on the Summit With speed conserved from the same slope, Mario instead bypasses the wing cap block and goes to the elevator, doing another BLJ. He uses this speed to climb the summit and quickly  backflip  to the top to kill speed and talk to King Bob-Omb. Mario begins the fight and throws him three times, positioning himself below the star at the end and collecting it 100 Coins & Footrace with Koopa the Quick Mario goes to and talks to Koopa the Quick to start the race. Afterwards, he throws a cork box at the bigger ones nearby and collects their coins, collecting the wing cap and the five red coins under the first bridge. Mario then triple jumps over the elevator and collects the red coin above, diving into and grabbing a nearby  Bob-omb . Mario throws the Bob-Omb and grabs it again in a  bloated  state, using its backwards speed to rapidly turn around  Chain Chomp's  pole to spawn its coins while also collecting the red coin above. After discarding of the bob-omb for its coin, Mario then BLJs off of the elevator once more, again grabbing the tree for one frame to redirect speed, but this time facing the red coin on the rock to the left, using that and the summit path to triple jump and fly into the finish with a time of 23.8 seconds. After this, he flies around the coins near the level  secrets , collecting 33 in total (and only 4 of the 5 secrets) and two lines of five coins on the summit path, getting stuck on an OoB wall for about one second. After redirecting himself from this and flying again, Mario collects the red coin on the island and four more coins around the secrets, before flying to the ground and dive recovering into the eight coins around the warp entrance in front of the summit. He spawns its 1-up and does a BLJ off of a nearby rock to build speed again, stopping at a pole after collecting another red coin and running around it to spawn its coins while also collecting another two sets of pole coins and a red coin nearby. Mario finally kicks a Bob-omb to collect the final coin and 100 coin star, turning him around to perform a final BLJ onto the rock behind him (this time pause-buffered due to the short length available) to climb the summit to reach Koopa the Quick, talk to him, and collect his star. Shoot to the Island in the Sky This star starts the same as Big Bob-Omb on the Summit, but instead once the rock is reached from the tree mario performs a high dive jump with this speed to reach the island. Once onto the island with a dive recover, Mario jumps up to the star block and breaks it with a ground pound, collecting it as soon as the cutscene ends. Behind Chain Chomp's Gate Mario reaches the elevator and performs a BLJ on it in the same route as the previous star, but directing himself towards the star in Chain Chomp's gate, jumping to collect it once reached by clipping through. Castle Lobby (8) Mario side BLJs on the stairs in front of the painting he exits to go to the  basement  and use the key on its door. Castle Basement Mario performs another side BLJ on the stairs in front of the door to the lobby to bypass the 30 star door into  Dire, Dire Docks Dire Dire Docks 100 Coins & Pole-Jumping for Red Coins Mario swims down and collects three lines of five coins in the whirlpool area, then the three coins at the bottom and finally almost all of the coins in the three rings of eight in the exit except for one. After this, Mario goes to the dock itself and collects the ring of eight red coins at the bottom in front of the entrance, then swimming up to the ground area to the right and collecting a line of five coins. Mario then goes left and does a side flip into a wall kick on a grate pillar to reach a higher platform and collect the first four red coins, jumping on the platforms ahead. Facing the submarine, Mario long jumps towards it, lands and does a  C^ input to gain hyperspeed  on one of its slopes. After exiting the slope, Mario conserves this speed with  firsties  (first frame wall kicks) to collect the remaining four red coins in the air and spawn the star, landing just next to the blue coin block. After ground pounding the block and collecting its coins, Mario also spawns the 100 coin star and collects it, then finally triple jumping on the submarine to collect the red coin star on its platform. Chests in the Current Mario swims to an almost vertical ceiling triangle to downwarp to the first chest and open it, then swimming to and opening the other three in order. Finally, as the star spawns, Mario swims towards its location and collects it shortly after the cutscene. Collect the Caps... Mario swims to the submarine and gains C^ hyperspeed on it once more, this time in a different spot to clip behind a wall above the grate containing the star. As there is a floor below, Mario is able to reach out of bounds to swim behind the gate and collect the star with no caps at all. Through the Jet Stream Mario swims to the jet stream and faces downwards into it passing through the five rings and positioning himself at where the star spawns, collecting it after the cutscene. Board Bowser's Sub Mario swims up to the front of the submarine and jumps onto a slope, then dive jumping off of it to reach the top and go to the star and collect it. The Manta Ray's Reward As collecting the previous star caused the entrance to move back, Mario had to perform long jumps to reach it. Once in the course, Mario swims downwards into the Manta Ray's rings, passing through all five and collecting the star in the spot it spawns after its cutscene. Bowser in the Fire Sea (with red coins) Mario performs dive jumps on the starting platform edges and side flips towards the first red coin. After collecting it, Mario long jumps to underneath the pole and uses the  hangable ceiling upwarp  glitch to pass the pole. Mario then BLJs on the elevator and grabs the pole again, conserving this speed. Dropping from the pole, Mario conserves this speed with a punch into collecting the second red coin and wall kicks off of a wall below him to redirect himself, and wall kicks again on the bottom of the elevator wall, collecting the third and fourth red coins before wall kicking numerous times, waiting for it to come down and using a final amount to leave the shaft, reaching the top of the rising platform with a double jump. Once on top, Mario double jumps again and wall kicks off of a higher platform to reach the fifth red coin and killing his speed to land on a platform with a bully, collecting the sixth red coin. Facing the rising platform again, Mario long jumps towards it and does a BLJ while it rises; once it is fully risen, Mario collects the seventh red coin and stops near the course end (while clipping through the structure before it) to burn himself in lava. After getting onto the structure, Mario jumps towards the final red coin and spawns the star. As the cut scene ends, Mario wall kicks and quick turns on a higher platform, then long jumps to the star and collects it. Finally, Mario long jumps twice and dives into the bowser fight entrance. Bowser Fight When the stage is tilted, Mario slides down to Bowser and grabs his tail, throwing him into the mine and defeating Bowser, collecting his key. Castle Basement (2), MIPS #1 and Toad #1 Upon exiting the course, Mario side BLJs on the entrance side and grabs MIPS while passing him, collecting his star. Mario then uses MIPS to clip into the  Hazy Maze Cave  door and talk to toad, kicking off of a nearby wall while collecting his star and landing mario inside the course entrance. After the text box ends, Mario enters the course instantly. Hazy Maze Cave Metal-Head Mario Can Move! Mario enters the course and performs dives with dive recovers to his left, jump diving over the pit rather than long jumping to enter the rolling rocks room. Mario then side flips into a wall on his right and wall kicks up to one of the emergency exit platforms, side flipping into a triple jump on the item block nearby to get over the room wall and land on the elevator at the end of the red coin room; as the most rooms in the course have no ceiling. Once on the elevator, Mario performs a pause-buffered BLJ to go straight to the star behind the switch gate in  Dorrie's  cavern and collect it. A-Maze-ing Emergency Exit Mario once again enters the rolling rocks room, going into the pit and performing a quick triple jump from a kick to wall kick off of a wall in front of him to his left, reaching the platform with the star and diving into it. Watch for Rolling Rocks Going to the same room as before, Mario slides down the side of the pit in front of him, jumping over the pit and GWKing off of the right side of the rolling rocks platform. Once in the corridor, Mario wall kicks three times on the first frame in order to reach and collect the star above the rolling rocks. 100 Coins & Elevate for 8 Red Coins This time, Mario goes to his right, killing the two scuttlebugs and collecting five coins along with theirs, before going down the left hallway again. In the rolling rocks room, Mario kills another scuttlebug for its coins and goes to the opposite side of the pit, doing a side BLJ near the rolling rocks platform on the left, quickly collecting the five coins in the corridor as well as three coins in the cavern entrance; clipping into that and the toxic maze exit. Once in the exit, Mario kicks to kill speed and activates the elevator, diving down to collect the five coins in the hallway below and entering the maze proper. In the maze, Mario kills four bats and activates the blue coin block, collecting most coins except the second one. (which is collected on the way back to the switch) Before exiting the maze, Mario kills a  snufit  and collects his coins and then first frame wall kicks into the entrance; collecting the five coins in this area. After this, Mario enters the red coin room and wall kicks up to a box, ledge grabbing it and collecting the first red coin. Mario then lands on the ground and does two more wall kicks up to the pole by the entrance, grabbing it and jumping from it up to the elevator. On the elevator, Mario long jumps towards the second and third red coins on a platform, then jumps down to a slope on a pillar while sliding off of it to gain speed and wall kick back up to the elevator again. From here, Mario long jumps off of it again, this time towards a wall while kicking off of it and long jumping on a floating cork box in front of the elevator path. Mario then lands on another pillar slope and slides off of it, double jumping on another floating cork box up to a platform and GWKing on the left side up to the fifth red coin and ground pounding onto a box below to collect a sixth red coin. On the ground, Mario side flips and wall kicks up to a  Mr. I , spinning around him and spawning his blue coin, long jumping from his platform towards the seventh red coin and then going down to his left to kill another two scuttlebugs for coins while the blue coin from earlier falls down, and finally wall kicking up to another floating box containing the last red coin. Unfortunately, Mario does not skip the red coin cutscene as he is not collecting any other coins on the same frame, but immediately falls down with the 100 coin star and collecting it, along with the red coin star spawned nearby. Swimming Beast in the Cavern Mario uses a similar route to Metal-Head Mario Can Move!, but instead dives towards the star on the island towards Dorrie, falling down and collecting it. Cavern of the Metal Cap Entering Hazy Maze Cave again, Mario goes to Dorrie's cavern in the same way as before, but sliding down the side of the island and jumping off of it to reach the door to the  Metal Cap  cavern with high speed and open it. Once in the cavern itself, Mario approaches the cap switch while collecting the four red coins on the river banks, and dives off of the cap switch into the water to skip the text box and collect the final four red coins, spawning the course red coin star and collecting it. Hazy Maze Cave (2) Navigating the Toxic Maze Mario goes to the same side BLJ spot as described in the red coin star, but instead directs his speed towards the star in the maze exit, kicking a wall to the left into the star and collecting it. Castle Basement (3) On the stairs directly in front of the course exit, Mario side BLJs and navigates into the entrance of  Shifting Sand Land . Shifting Sand Land 100 Coins & Pyramid Puzzle Upon entering the course, Mario grabs a crazy box and bounces with it, activating a Bob-omb fuse along the way and causing a  Fly Guy  to dive into a second Bob-omb, killing all three while Mario collects coins from all four objects. Near the wing cap structure, Mario kills a  Pokey  and throws a cork box at a larger box in the centre of the structure while stomping on a goomba; collecting all coins resulting from this. (including a red coin in the larger box) Near the  Tox-Boxes , Mario kills another pokey and rapidly dives into the adjacent four pillars to climb it. From the top of this pillar, Mario long jumps to a platform on the side of the pyramid and uses a slide kick to slide down another side, recovering and kicking to conserve speed up to and kill another pokey with a ground pound. Using the pillar nearby, Mario BLJs and collects a line of five coins behind him and ground pounding a fourth pokey in his way. Mario then grabs a nearby crazy box, cancelling the bounces with a pillar and long jumping towards the pyramid entrance. Inside the pyramid, Mario ground pounds the blue coin block and collects the three blue coins on a platform by the edge of the sand pit. At the other side, Mario wall kicks on a pillar and then a platform side to collect all but one of the eight coins on the  hangable ceiling  above. Making his way to the top of the  Eyerok  entrance, Mario collects two more coins and side flips with a wall kick to reach the platform above, collecting four coins while ascending the shifting blocks. Mario then turns around and double jumps into a wall kick up to reach the first secret and its coin below the top of the pyramid, collecting nine of the ten coins behind it. After descending and collecting two more secrets/coins, Mario collects the fourth secret with its coin, while momentarily skipping the fifth to jump dive for five coins below another hangable ceiling and sliding down the slope below; bouncing off of a wall for backwards momentum conserved with kicks. Using a  quick turn , Mario collects four more coins before the final secret and coin, collecting both on the same frame and skipping the secrets star cutscene. Once both stars are spawned, Mario lands and jumps to the 100 coin star; and once it is collected, Mario long jumps to the secrets star. Shining Atop the Pyramid Mario turns left and dives down a slope, conserving the recovery with a slide kick and landing him on the pyramid. Once on the pyramid, Mario jumps to a higher platform and long jumps towards the pyramid slope to his left, dive jumping into the star. Stand Tall on the Four Pillars Mario goes to the pyramid with the same slope as before, but instead turning left on the pyramid and entering it. Inside the pyramid, Mario goes to the eyeorok boss entrance and side flips into it, wall kicking to go inside with a ledge grab. Mario then dives towards the boss and takes  fall damage . Once the fight begins, Mario alternates between attacking the left and right hands until both are defeated. Before the ending cutscene, he goes up to underneath the star spawn and quickly jumps and ground pounds to collect it. In the Talons of the Big Bird Instead of aiming towards the pyramid, Mario conserves slope speed towards the furthest pillar, ascending it and diving towards  Klepto  just as he passes; spawning the star. After the cutscene ends, Mario lands on the pyramid and again slide kicks down the slope, aiming towards the star and jumping into it. Inside the Ancient Pyramid Mario approaches the nearby bob-omb and activates its fuse, throwing and grabbing it bloated for backwards speed. Using this speed, Mario reaches the top of the pyramid and clips inside by ground pounding while moving backwards. (as he is not tangible) Once on the elevator at the top, he jumps outside of it and dives into the star to collect it. Free Flying for 8 Red Coins This time, Mario long jumps behind him into a slope facing him, dive sliding into it and conserving speed off of it with kicks and slide kicks into the first red coin. Facing the slope again with a quick turn, Mario triple jumps and then jump dives down the opposite side, recovering and jumping to the wing cap block. With the wing cap, he slides and jumps to the pillar on his left and BLJs, repositioning himself and bouncing off of his  next intended position  in OoB to jump forward with massive speed towards the second red coin in the air. Before landing, Mario wall kicks on the first frame off of tox-box platforms to redirect speed and collect the third red coin; then triple jumping into the flying state and turning around on OoB to hyperspeed fly into four more red coins. (including one on the ground in the oasis) Facing a larger box, he dives into the ground and kicks; both conserving speed and breaking the box with the final red coin inside. Once the star spawns, Mario side flips behind him onto the structure top, long jumping into and collecting the star. Castle Basement (4) As there is nowhere to BLJ on, Mario simply long jumps, dives and recovers into the  Lethal Lava Land  painting. Lethal Lava Land Elevator Tour in the Volcano Mario long jumps towards the rising bridge, getting burned by lava twice but cancelling the second time with the floor of the bridge. While the bridge raises, he performs a pause-buffered BLJ on it facing the volcano and entering it. Inside the volcano, Mario faces a pole and long jumps towards it while using a lava boost to reach up to it. He then grabs onto this pole, jumping and regrabbing to climb faster. After climbing another pole, Mario reaches the tour end and long jumps towards the star. Boil the Big Bully Instead of the volcano, Mario BLJs towards the bully and clips underneath his platform; while killing this speed with a lava burn and kicking the big  bully  as soon as he reaches the top, knocking him off instantly. Before the star cutscene begins, he triple jumps and dives towards the spawn point, and collects the star with a dive recover as soon as it ends. Red-Hot Log Rolling This time, Mario BLJs on the bridge while facing the rolling log area star, clipping through the wall and collecting it. 8-Coin Puzzle with 15 Pieces Using the same BLJ, Mario faces the red coin puzzle and uses his backwards speed to direct himself around all 8 red coins, spawning the star and jumping underneath it with a one frame ground pound to collect it. Bully the Bullies Facing the platform with the bullies, Mario BLJs towards them and cancels it with a ground pound in the middle of the trio, kicking them all off the edge as they approach him. As the second big bully falls, he ground pounds him to change his trajectory into the lava and ground pounding again into position as the star spawns. As soon the cutscene ends, Mario collects the star. 100 Coins & Hot-Foot-It into the Volcano Instead of using the bridge, Mario instead breaks the shell block and rides it on the lava. He collects the five coins under the bridge and jumps up to the Mr. I, spinning around it and collecting seven more coins. On the puzzle, Mario collects seven of the eight red coins before jumping back to the Mr. I platform for his blue coin and the coins spawned by the puzzle becoming solved as soon as they appear. Mario then collects two sets of five coins on a ramp and sinking platform and then jumping onto and from the big bully platform towards the bullies, collecting the ring of eight coins around them. After this, Mario goes to the island with another Mr. I on it, spinning around him while collecting the ring of eight coins. Before collecting the blue coin as it spawns, Mario first collects the four coins on four sinking platforms nearby, and then going to another eight coin ring by two bullies. Finally, before entering the volcano, Mario collects another set of five coins on a sinking platform and three coins on the rotating platform surrounding it. Once in the volcano, he long jumps towards three coins on a rock and then towards the lava waterfall, boosting all the way up. At the top, Mario dives and recovers into a final set of five coins and collects the 100 coin star after it spawns. After this, he double jumps from a dive grind into a pole, jumping from it and another pole at their base on one frame before wall kicking to his left onto the star platform, diving and recovering into the star. Castle Basement (5) and MIPS #2 Upon leaving LLL, Mario grabs MIPS again and collects his second star. He also uses MIPS to clip into the pillar room and pound them, draining the moat. Once drained, mario goes outside and enters  Vanish Cap under the Moat Vanish Cap under the Moat Mario long jumps towards an wall and kicks off of it, sliding down the slide and collecting the first four coins. After collecting the bottom rightmost coin, Mario jumps onto the slide edge and dives behind it, cancelling it on the edge. Before reaching the bottom, Mario dives to prevent fall damage and wall kicks off of the elevators and their posts to collect the next three red coins as well as the final red coin in front of the cap switch. After the star spawns, Mario dives onto the cap switch to activate it, then recovers and jumps off of it with a wall kick on the wall behind it, allowing him to jump high enough over the grate to reach the star with a dive. Castle Lobby (9) After re-entering VCutM and pause exiting, Mario spawns in the castle lobby. He goes to the stairs on the right and BLJs into the  Jolly Roger Bay  painting Jolly Roger Bay Treasure of the Ocean Cave Mario collects the metal cap to his right and redirects his speed with a wall kick against the wall in front of it, diving afterwards. This faces him towards a rock, where Mario BLJs on a small amount of ceiling triangle underwater, turning himself towards and clipping into the ocean cave. Once Mario reaches the treasure chests, he is underneath the first one and clips up to the platform above with a kick. After opening the remaining three in order, Mario kicks off of the wall in front and ground pounds while the star spawns, collecting it as the cutscene ends.  Blast to the Stone Pillar This time, Mario immediately BLJs on the rock and lands in the water with conserved speed and  C^ jumps  out of it onto the star platform. On the platform, Mario dives and dive recovers, then breaking the star block with a ground pound and collecting the star. Plunder in the Sunken Ship Mario collects the metal cap and again BLJs, this time falling down to the ship and clipping into the entrance, bypassing the eel. Once inside, Mario opens the chests in order and swims to the top of the ship, slope jumping and then ground pounding into the star block, collecting the star inside while Mario performs his underwater star animation in the air; as the water has lowered from where he collected it. 100 Coins & Red Coins on the Ship Afloat Using the same metal cap and BLJs as in the previous star, Mario collects two of the eight coins on the ring by the stone pillar and redirects himself around the underwater area towards the first four red coins in the clams. Then, Mario enters the ocean cave and kills two of the three goombas while collecting four of the eight coins in the ring near the treasure chests. Approaching the blue coin block, he turns around, collects the remaining four coins plus a goomba coin, and kills the final goomba before ground pounding it and spawning the coins. Once he collects the blue coins, Mario wall kicks towards the two remaining goomba coins and leaves the cave just as the metal cap runs out. Outside the cave, he swims around collects the eight coins by its entrance and then swims horizontally into a steep floor to ascend faster. At the top, Mario collects five of the remaining six coins around the stone pillar and swims back down to another eight coin ring, collecting its coins. No longer in the water, Mario grabs onto the pole by the  Bob-omb Buddy  repeatedly grabbing and letting go to climb faster, collecting the fifth red coin at the top and going to a vertical line of five red coins. Here, he jumps towards the wall and GWKs on it, collecting them and approaching a  block switch . After activating the switch, Mario collects a line of five red coins and wall kicks to face another line of five to collect, then side flipping to a final line of five. Facing the ship, he jumps and dives onto it, collecting the final three red coins and spawning both that star and the 100 coin star. After collecting the 100 coin star, Mario also collects the red coin star from jumping into it. Through the Jet Stream Using the same BLJ as before with the metal cap, Mario simply faces the star in the jet stream and collects it with his high speed. Can the Eel Come Out to Play? With the same BLJ and metal cap, Mario lands on top of the eel and passes through his object hitboxes while also walking around on the steep floor triangles around it, to wait for it to come out. Once the star is visible, he jumps to it and spawns it, falling down and collecting it after the spawn cutscene. Secret Aquarium Mario enters  the course  with a double jump dive. Once inside, he swims around to collect the four red coins in the middle (and eight yellows) and then the four at the bottom. Once the star is spawned, Mario swims towards it and collects it. Castle Lobby (10) In the JRB room, Mario side BLJs by a fish tank and opens the door into the courtyard after clipping through various rooms into the  courtyard . Courtyard Mario performs two long jumps towards the  boo  containing  Big Boo's Haunt  and wall kicks off of the back wall while the course spawns, jumping above it and entering it. (for re-entry, Mario uses a variety of methods, such as side flipping or simply jumping and kicking) Big Boo's Haunt Go on a Ghost Hunt Mario enters the mansion, first going into the top left room and diving into the two ghost to kill them. Using the low ceiling of the bookcase, Mario BLJs into the remaining rooms of boos on the first floor and kills them, spawning Big Boo and ground pounding him before his first text box appears. He then finishes him off with kicks and double jumps up and wall kicks to the star spawn, collecting it after dive recovering into it on a railing. Big Boo's Balcony Mario goes to the side of the mansion and first frame wall kicks on it and the edge of the course until he reaches the top. At the top, he slide kicks into Big Boo on the balcony and dives into him. Using the slope on the right, Mario jumps into Big Boo and defeats him, then using a dive grind to reach the star before it spawns, and finally collects the star. Eye to Eye in the Secret Room Mario enters the mansion, and once inside, double jumps to his right and GWKs up to the second floor; collecting the vanish cap at the top with a kick. To reach the third floor, he goes to the top right room and long jumps into a wall kick up to the third attic and into the secret room. Inside the secret room, Mario runs around the giant Mr. I and ground pounds into the star before it spawns, collecting it afterwards. Secret of the Haunted Books Once in the mansion, Mario side flips to his left and GWKs onto the second floor, entering the adjacent room. Once inside, Mario long jumps into the wall on his right, wall kicking and then diving off of it into the star and collecting it. 100 Coins & Ride Big Boo's Merry-Go-Round   Double star spawn in  BBH First, Mario enters the top left room on the first floor, side flipping behind him and wall kicking up to his first red coin. Once down, he long jumps into the vanish cap block and wall kicks off of it while breaking it; then ground pounding into the two boos and collecting their blue coins. Then, he side flips behind him and wall kicks into his leftmost bookshelf, collecting a blue coin from a haunted book and another red coin. Finished in that room, Mario enters the back left room and runs around a Mr I, ground pounding a boo for a blue coin once his death animation plays; then double jumping, wall kicking and diving towards a red coin while finishing with collecting the blue coin from the Mr. I. In the mansion lobby, Mario side flips behind him and and wall kicks onto the stair side, dive jumping off of it towards the top right room on the second floor. Inside, he collects the two blue coins from the haunted books and triple jumps up with a wall kick to the third floor attic. In the attic, Mario ground pounds the blue coin block and collects the spawned blue coins, as well as one from a boo. Back in the previous room, he collects the red coin by the tilting platform and uses said platform to reach the room below with another red coin and a boo, collecting its blue coin. Mario then falls down to the Merry-Go-Round outside and enters it, where five boos spawn. Mario collects four of the five blue coins from each, avoiding the fifth until defeating Big Boo and spawning his star, causing it and the 100 coin star to spawn at the same time. After collecting the 100 coin star, he collects the other star from wall kicking into it. Seek the 8 Red Coins Inside the mansion with stars, Mario triple jumps on them and dives towards the back right room on the second floor. Inside this room, he collects the first two red coins underneath the coffins and BLJs on the bottom right one, clipping through rooms and collecting the red coin on the grate, beside the tilting platform, by the pit and behind the piano in that order. Once in the bookshelf room on the first floor, Mario's speed is killed, then wall kicking on the two shelves with the final two red coins and spawning the star. After the star spawns, he enters the lobby and side flips to his left, wall kicking off of the second floor towards the star and collecting it with a ground pound. Castle Lobby (11) After leaving the courtyard, Mario long jumps to underneath the second key door and side flips up to it, clipping through the ceiling and using the second key on the door. Castle Upstairs Mario double jumps up and clips into the stairs with a ledge grab, then side BLJing on them to reach  Tiny-Huge Island  through the huge entrance. Tiny-Huge Island 100 Coins & Wiggler's Red Coins At the start of the course, Mario jumps, dives and dive recovers into the first giant goomba while ground pounding the other two to collect three blue coins. Afterwards, he makes his way to the koopa and C^ jump kicks it to retrieve the shell. Once on the shell, Mario jumps up to the lakitu and collects its five coins and goes back to the koopa blue coin, then jumps on and off of the slope to his right to collect the line of five coins in front of the  wiggler  cave lower entrance. Moving towards out of bounds and jumping onto the small islet with the pole, he enters it and water on the same frame to activate the  shell mario glitch  and gain constant forward momentum for greater speed. Using this speed, Mario exits the water to his left and ground pounds another giant goomba while turning around, and side flipping into its blue coin; approaching the line of five coins on the thin wooden platform while wall kicking between it and another platform to collect them. Reaching the platform above with the pipe, he ground pounds another two goombas and crawls while moving to collect them, then turning around and side flipping, jumping and side flipping again up to the highest pipe, going left and down to ground pound three more goombas and collecting their three blue coins, side flipping backwards into a line of five coins along the way. Finally, Mario clips into the steep floor near the top of the mountain with enough speed to immediately fall down into the lower wiggler cave entrance. Once inside, he loses the shell, but dives onto the platforms in front of him to collect the first four red coins, then turning right and long jumping from a lower platform to collect two more and wall kick in front of him towards the blue coin block; ground pounding it, collecting its two blue coins and the seventh red coin. Lastly, Mario double jumps up and wall kicks towards the eighth red coin; spawning the 100 coin and then red coin star once that has been collected; with him then diving down to the red coin star. The Tip Top of the Huge Island For this star, Mario slide kicks into the tiny painting and; once inside the course, triple jumps and dives up onto the platform with the highest pipe, entering it. Now in the huge island, he goes down and side BLJs, clipping through the island mountain to reach the star block and ground pounding it; collecting it after it spawns. Five Itty Bitty Secrets Again in the tiny island, Mario triple jumps behind him and GWKs off of the wall to his right to climb over it with the right angle and activating the first secret. Once down, he long jumps twice to the second secret, turning around and performing a long jump, dive and dive recover up to the third secret; collecting it while slope jumping for forward momentum. Using a neutral joystick kick for conserved momentum, Mario reaches the fourth secret and side flips behind him; long jumping into the island mountain side to upwarp to the water above him with the fifth and final secret, spawning the star. Once spawned, he slides down the slope towards it and jumps, taking fall damage while collecting the star. Pluck the Piranha Flower Entering the tiny island, Mario long jumps twice to the pipe in front of him and enters it, taking him to the huge island. Outside, he jump kicks to kill the first piranha and dives into the one behind him. After the third spawns, he jump kicks through it and kills the fourth with a dive from a wall kick. Finally, Mario side flips through the fifth and final piranha to towards the star spawn point, positioning himself to collect it after the cutscene. Rematch with Koopa the Quick Reaching the same upper pipe in the tiny island and performing the same side BLJ in the huge island, Mario instead directs his speed towards Koopa the Quick, briefly stopping to talk to him. As soon as the text box closes, his speed is kept, and he kicks backwards over a pit and turns left, being briefly propelled upwards by wind before killing the speed with a dive in front of the finish (as to not fall behind him) with a time of 2.4 seconds. After this, Mario moves around and passes time until Koopa also arrives at the finish line, where he gives him his star. After it spawns, he  backflips  into it and ground pounds to collect it. Make Wiggler Squirm Entering the pipe into huge island from tiny island in the same place, Mario triple jumps up and dives to the right behind him into the island mountain side, clipping in and upwarping in the water. Now underneath the top, he swims below the floor and into the wiggler arena entrance. After closing his textbox, Mario jumps down onto wiggler and hits him for the first time, then slide kicking through wiggler and jump diving off of him and hitting him for the second time. Finally, as soon as the second text box closes, he side flips behind him and wall kicks towards wiggler and jumps on him twice, hitting him for the final time; then ground pounding into place while his death animation plays and the star spawns, collecting it afterwards. Castle Upstairs (2) By the room entrance, Mario side BLJs to his left and clips through various walls into the entrance of  Snowman's Land . Snowman's Land In the Deep Freeze Mario goes to his right and double jumps up onto the ice structure, then diving down into and collecting the star after bonking on the hole into it. Whirl from the Freezing Pond This time, Mario goes behind him and slides down the slope with a dive, conserving the speed with a slide kick and double jumping over the rock on the left of the course. After kicking along its top, he then slides down its middle slope and jumps from it into the star block, ground pounding into it and collecting it after it spawns. Chill with the Bully Mario goes to the slope on his right and performs a C^ slide on it, cancelling it with a dive and C^ sliding again towards the platform with the chill bully and pushing him off. Once off, he positions himself under the star spawn point with a ground pound and collects it after the cutscene. Snowman's Big Head Mario dives and recovers in front of him and then double jumps onto the slope in front of the snowman base, triple jumping and  straining  to his left onto the platform just above. Once on, he goes right and side flips to his left, wall kicking off of the snowman, platform with the penguin and snowman again onto the penguin's head, side flipping behind him into and collecting the star. Into the Igloo Mario triple jumps from the same slope, but instead of straining to his right, dives and then briefly  dive grinds  in front of the igloo, entering it from the back. (as there is no wall collision behind the igloo) Inside, Mario BLJs to his left, bypassing walls and reaching the vanish cap block, then long jumps underneath it and dives from a wall kick into collecting the vanish cap. Finally, he approaches the star, dives from a double jump and collects it on the platform within the ice. 100 Coins & Shell Shreddin' for Red Coins Mario enters the igloo again, but this time, stops his BLJ at an ice wall with 20 coins, collecting them all and leaving the igloo again. Outside, he slides down the slope in front, collecting its eight red coins and jumping off of it, then killing a  spindrift  with a kick and collecting its three coins. Going to his left, Mario triple jumps over the freezing pond onto the area with the star block from earlier and shell block, breaking the latter and turning around to get on the shell. Once on, Mario goes forward and to his left beside the pond, collecting the first four red coins before turning right and going down to the fifth red coin in front of a  moneybag . By using its duplication glitch, Mario enters and exits its home for about 15 seconds until enough are spawned to collect fifty coins, even lagging the game slightly with the amount of objects. (as this was before rapid duplication was discovered or understood) Once done, he goes underneath the chill bully platform and collects the sixth and seventh red coin, before killing another spindrift and collecting two of its three coins; waiting for the third to get near enough to collect it and the eighth red coin on the same frame, bypassing an additional star spawn cutscene. As Mario cancelled the shell riding just below the 100 coin star, he quickly jumps and ground pounds under it to avoid upwards velocity while collecting it, then going to and collecting the red coin star after facing the original C^ slope and turning right. Castle Upstairs (3) and Toad #2 As there is nowhere nearby to side BLJ in the Snowman's Land room, Mario instead decides to leave the room and go to toad, collecting his star after talking to him. Once done, he long jumps behind into the  Tall, Tall Mountain  painting. Tall Tall Mountain Breathtaking View from Bridge Mario goes to his left and long jumps towards a very steep slope on the mountain, then clipping through it with a dive (as the  floor  hitbox is thin) and upwarping to the water underneath a floor above; jumping onto it. Once on, he approaches a wall corner in front of him to his left and side flips into it, performing a rapid chain of GWKs on each frame (including one that is pause buffered) up this corner. On top, Mario triple jumps onto the nearby side of the bridge and wall kicks off of it, diving into and collecting the star. Mysterious Mountainside This time, Mario long jumps behind him and goes to a wall underneath the mountainside alcove, triple jumping and GWKing to his right and then ground pounding underneath to clip into the alcove, just slightly to the right of the star before collecting it. 100 Coins & Scary 'Shrooms, Red Coins Going to the water beside him, Mario performs a pause buffered BLJ, going to the wind area near the mountainside and riding it up to the red coin mushroom and landing on it. From here, he long jumps twice to the rock wall with red coins and jumps from sliding down a slope to his right, wall kicking and then quickly dive recovering on the platform in front of the wall to collect the first two red coins; and then finally side flipping to his right to wall kick up above. By the hangable vine bridge, Mario long jumps underneath it and collects its five coins, wall kicking to his right and collecting the third red coin before side flipping against the rock wall to wall kick up to the fourth and final red coin in this area. Above the wall, Mario side flips and dives to his right down a slope with gained speed towards three goombas, bypassing them and instead side flipping onto the mountain side and wall kicking up to the bridge, collecting the five red coins on it; before finally diving down off of it to a line of five coins in front of the slide entrance and going inside. In the slide, Mario starts by C^ sliding for the first ten coins before turning and proceeding as normal, collecting the slide's three blue coins and 36 yellow coins before exiting from jumping off of the slide into the mountainside star area. From this area, Mario goes back to the water and BLJs down to the coin ring by the crazy box and collecting its eight coins before redirecting himself around to the mushrooms with the final four red coins while kicking over gaps and stopping just on the mushroom with the fifth red coin, then diving and recovering off of the mushrooms with the remaining three red coins, spawning the 100 coin star and then the red coin star. After collecting the 100 coin star, Mario long jumps thrice to the large mushroom in front of him and dives into the red coin star, collecting it. Scale the Mountain Mario progresses up to the bridge using the same route as the first star, but instead aims the wall kick into the corner, GWKing up about five times up in front of the bridge and triple jump diving to the top of the mountain and collecting the star. Mystery of the Monkey Cage Reaching the top of the mountain in a similar method as before, (but with only two GWKs on the bridge) Mario dives into  Ukiki  and grabs him as soon as he moves. After closing his dialogue, he frees him with a ground pound in front of the star cage, and while the star spawns, Mario clips underneath the bridge waterfall very precisely and falls down to the death barrier, upwarping with the water and collecting the star as soon as the fall death activates to skip the star cutscene. Blast to the Lonely Mushroom Using a similar BLJ found in the 100 coin star, (but without pause buffering) Mario faces it towards the mushroom with the star and collects it after kicking over the gap. Castle Upstairs (4) As there is nowhere to side BLJ or otherwise, Mario simply long jumps, dives, dive recovers and jump dives into  Wet-Dry World  on the lowest water level. Wet-Dry World Secrets in the Shallows & Sky Mario long jumps, dives and dive recovers to the box in the wall, pushing it briefly to activate the first secret before turning around and pushing the second box while obtaining the second secret. After being pushed enough, he jumps onto the box and long jumps just underneath the item block, collecting the third secret without breaking the box (due to differing object hitboxes) and wall kicking five times frame-perfect up to the ramp near the cannon. On the ramp, Mario BLJs and bounces into OoB with the gained speed; redirecting him. While facing towards the arrow lift structure, he wall kicks back again and GWKs on the right side item block by the fourth secret without breaking it, and then wall kicks on the edge of the platform with the  chuckya  to his right and collecting the fifth secret just under its item block, spawning the star. After the star spawns, in order to collect it, Mario wall kicks with high speed on first frames on the sides of the course boundary walls until he reaches the star. Top O' the Town Mario re-enters the painting with a long jump, raising the water level slightly. With this, Mario bounces on a  skeeter  from a long jump onto the ramp leading up to the higher area of the course. Once on top, he long jumps to his left and immediately wall kicks on the elevator structure and the wall opposite to get on top of it and triple jump dive up to the star block, breaking it with a ground pound and collecting its star. 100 Coins & Go to Town for Red Coins At the lowest water level, Mario goes to the blue coin block with a jump dive and ground pounds it, collecting its six blue coins with dives and dive recovers. Once done, Mario triple jumps up above and then triple jumps again into a wall corner, GWKing to his left and collecting the coins in a ring of eight, then side flipping up onto the pillar in the middle at the very edge, falling off then diving and dive recovering on to quickly break the item block with ten coins inside. From here, he activates the block switch and double jumps a few times onto the spawned blocks with edge grinding, then side flipping to his right up to the next ten coin item block; breaking it with a kick. Done in the upper section of the course, Mario long jumps just to the left of the town entrance and uses a wall kick to get inside, bonking just before entering the water. After swimming through the tunnel, he is in the town, and activates a water changer to lower the water level; reaching the cork boxes near the top in front of the tunnel just before the water is below them. On here, Mario is just underneath the first cork box, and simply jumps to break it and collect the first red coin, then long jumps to the second box and jumps under it for the second red coin. To go down, he quick turns and double jump dives, falling off of an edge into a ring of eight coins and collecting them. After long jumping onto a wall behind him and wall kicking up, Mario breaks the third and fourth red coin box by jumping just underneath them and also landing on their respective platforms; then long jumping to another rooftop with a line of five coins and the fifth red coin box, breaking it with a kick. From this kick and facing a higher rooftop behind him to his right, Mario triple jump dives onto it; collecting its line of five coins and breaking its red coin box with another kick. Going down again with a long jump, he triple jump dives over the red coin star spawn point to collect the seventh red coin and grab the pole, immediately jumping off, diving and dive recovering through the line of five coins in front of him and going down to the skeeter, landing on him and collecting two of his three coins. Waiting slightly for the third coin to approach the final red coin, Mario collects both on the same frame, skipping the red coin star cutscene and collecting the 100 coin star, cancelling the upward velocity with the nearby floor; and then finally diving and dive recovering into the red coin star. Shocking Arrow Lifts! Using the same long jump to raise the water level slightly, Mario double jumps behind him to his left, then quickly diving and dive recovering on an edge into a jump dive to a platform with a higher water changer. After activating this, the water begins to rise, and Mario uses a bounce from a skeeter after a dive recover to reach a floating wooden platform; long jumping to his left and then wall kicking under the star platform and on an arrow lift towards the star box. Once underneath it, the box breaks just as he wallkicks again and starts a ground pound, collecting the star after it spawns. Express Elevator--Hurry Up! Mario goes to his left and breaks the box at the base of the elevator with a dive recover, then first frame wall kicking up the shaft until he is underneath the star, clipping very slightly into the gap to the side of it to collect the star. Quick Race Through Downtown! With the higher water level, and reaching the higher water changer with a similar method to before, (but with different positioning) Mario instead jump dives onto a floading wooden platform to his left as it rises, long jumping again off of it and then wall kicking and diving onto the ramp by the cannon; turning around and BLJing on it. (pause buffering once) Now clipped inside the tunnel leading to the town, Mario swims down to the water changer and back up to a roof, positioning himself and launching with the conserved speed in the water from the BLJ into the area normally reached with the vanish cap. Inside, he lands in the water again and launches the rest of his conserved speed with a jump to collect the star. Castle Upstairs (5) Mario exits the painting behind him and BLJs on the stairs to clip behind the 50 star door, then stopping his speed in front of the entrance to  Wing Mario over the Rainbow , side flipping and wall kicking up to it and diving inside Wing Mario over the Rainbow Mario goes to the wing cap block and breaks it with a side flip behind him, doing a low triple jump into flying and collecting the first and second red coins. Flying to the bottom of the course, Mario talks to the Bob-omb buddy and activates the cannon with him, then entering it and immediately firing and collecting the third and fourth red coins while slowly flying up to a higher cannon and firing again. By pressing Z on the same frame as the cannon aims, he fires straight upwards and collects the fifth and six red coins at the top of the course, then flying down and collecting the final two red coins and spawning the star; flying into it and collecting it Castle Upstairs (6) Mario dives down, and then double jump dives from a kick up to the  Tick Tock Clock  entrance on the fast setting. Tick Tock Clock Stop Time for Red Coins Mario long jumps twice towards the rotating platforms and wall kicks, then dives and recovers onto the lowest rightmost platform, collecting the first two red coins. On here, he side flips to his left and wall kicks up two platforms and collecting another red coin; then jumping forward and falling down to collect three more. Landing on a middle platform with a kick, Mario collects the sixth red coin, then dives and recovers on a platform in front of him on the left, collecting the last two red coins and spawning the red coin star in front of him, as he falls down and collects it. 100 Coins & Stomp on the Thwomp Entering on the fast setting again, Mario goes to the coin item block by the spinning platforms with red coins and side flips under it, collecting its ten coins and then double jumping and wall kicking onto the platform above, stopping on a floor and collecting a red coin. On here, he side flips and wall kicks again onto a platform above with another red coin and slides down it as it turns left, jumping and collecting another red coin then side flipping behind into a double jump out of the rotating platform area with two more red coins. After then double jumping and then wall kicking in between a thin gap, Mario then double jumps onto a moving bar and wall kicks onto a small elevator, grabbing its ledge. Moving forward slightly, he side flips behind him on the elevator into a line of five coins and then dive grinds on the nearby edge to turn around and long jump into a wall kick up to the blue coin block, reaching it with a GWK bonk in the air. After ground pounding it, he long jumps towards the six blue coins before dive grinding off of the moving pendulum, collecting them and turning around and then triple jumping up to a wall kick to reach the area above the pendulum pit with straining. Quick turning, Mario double jumps up to rotating blocks and side flips onto the left one, double jumping again on it into a wall kick up above, diving and recovering at the top for extra speed. Conserving it with a kick, he double jumps and wall kicks into a grated area with a coin item block, collecting its ten coins with a kick and double jump. From this, Mario wall kicks again twice up to the thin platform near the top underneath the higher spinning hand, dive jumping twice on rotating triangle blocks and side flipping into another ten coin item block. Double jumping below the hand, he lands by another item block with coins and collects another set of ten with another kick, then triple jump diving to the floor underneath the thwomp area with the final ten coin item block, opening it with a side flip and spawning the 100 coin star just above while collecting it with a ground pound. After this, Mario long jumps slightly to his right to wall kick twice onto the thwomp top and side flip into his star. Get a Hand On the random setting, Mario triple jumps on the conveyor in front of him while it changes direction and wall kicks twice slightly to his right, then finally diving into and collecting the star in the alcove by the lower hand. The Pit and the Pendulums On the same setting, and with the same two wall kicks, Mario's angle is slightly different and he instead GWKs into the alcove, jumping into its side and wall kicking on the side, a cog and the cage, landing on top and double jumping with two wall kicks up to the pit and collecting its star. Timed Jumps on Moving Bars Reaching the pit again as before on the same setting, this time with only one wall kick up, Mario lands on the pendulum. While it moves forwards, he triple jumps on it and wall kicks up to the moving bars, then turning around and double jumping into a wall kick on the highest one into the cage with the star, collecting it. Roll into the Cage On the same setting, the cage is reached as before, but with wall kicks aiming right into the cage to collect the star. Castle Upstairs (7) and Toad #3 Before entering  Rainbow Ride , Mario long jumps to toad and collects his star, then side flipping up to the left of the entrance and long jumping into it, cancelling the long jump on the floor and diving into the course. Rainbow Ride Cruiser Crossing The Rainbow Mario goes slightly behind him to his left and triple jumps towards the rotating platforms, wall kicking to his right on the leftmost one. On the platform to the right, Mario triple jumps and uses a  lakitu  bounce to reach the floor above and then dive grinding slightly to climb and turn towards the pole; grabbing it twice to ascend faster. Above the pole and in front, Mario triple jumps onto the next pole and turns slightly behind him to wall kick twice up onto the blue carpet obstacles, diving, recovering and side flipping up onto the platform by the ship. Finally, he long jumps onto the ship and collects the star without using the carpet. The Big House in the Sky This time, Mario wall kicks on the rightmost platform to his left towards the red coin maze, diving and dive recovering towards it. Once near the maze, Mario triple jumps into it with some dive grinds, then dives, dive recovers, jumps and wall kicks up to the slope in the maze, jumping from it and wall kicking up to the Bob-omb buddy. After reaching him with a ledge grab, Mario activates the elevator and passes time waiting for it to rise again. Once it has risen enough, he BLJs on it and talks to the Bob-omb buddy to activate the cannon for a later star. With conserved speed after the talk, Mario punches, jumps and wall kicks to redirect his hyperspeed, grabbing a pole at the opposite end of the course, sliding down to the base with conserved speed and double jumping up to the house interior, first frame wall kicking up the walls of the house seven times until he reaches the top exit, collecting the star without the carpet. 100 Coins & Somewhere over the Rainbow Going in the opposite direction, Mario dives and dive recovers to the line of five coins leading towards the swinging bridge on his right, dive jumping over the platform in the way and kicking to conserve a small amount of speed onto it. Once on, he side flips behind him to collect its five coins and then side flips again onto the top of the swing; and side flipping another time up to a goomba, instead collecting the five coins above the slope by diving and recovering twice up it. Now done in this area, he long jumps back to the rotating platforms and collects four of the eight coins on the most nearby one while side flipping into a lakitu for his five coins, then collecting the remaining four from the ring. After long jumping to the rotating platform opposite and collecting its eight coins, Mario long jumps to the red coin maze and wall kicks up to collect the red coin on the outside, then triple jumping up and side flipping behind him into the wall above an entrance to wall kick and dive into another red coin. Instead of dive recovering, he falls off of a platform into the maze down, dive recovers and dives again to collect three more red coins. Falling down, diving and recovering, Mario collects two more red coins and lands in front of a  kuromame  as it shoots fire. Not collecting the last red coin, he instead goes down to the blue coin block, ground pounds it and collects its six blue coins by wall kicking up the shaft on the size of the maze 9 times. Leaving the maze with long jumps, he wall kicks four times up onto falling platforms with a 1up using glass carpet obstacles and long jumping off of them, onto more in front of the ship with a ledge grab. Pulling himself up, Mario turns left and double jumps up while quickly diving and recovering onto the ship. Now on the ship, he collects three of the eight coins in the ring, throws a Bob-omb into the lakitu and kicks another to collect their two coins, the lakitu's five coins and the remaining five coins in the ring. Entering the cannon, Mario fires himself and stops at the chuckya, throwing him for the final five coins to spawn the 100 coin star and collect it on the same frame he breaks the item block and spawns its star, skipping its cutscene. Finally, he jumps and ground pounds into both stars and collects them. Tricky Triangles! This time, Mario goes to the carpet as it begins to move and BLJs on it to reach the base of the triangles, landing on the block switch and activating it. Once the triangles have become usable, he jumps onto the first one and side flips into the wall on his left, wall kicking up to the exit of the triangle are and collecting the star. Swingin' in the Breeze Mario turns around and triple jumps towards the leftmost part of the rotating platforms, wall kicking towards the top of the pole nearby. From here, he long jumps to the platform near the final swinging bridge and wall kicks on it to  ledge grab  up. On top, Mario dive grinds into a double jump dive onto the swinging bridge top, where he dive recovers on it and jump dives into the star. Coins Amassed in a Maze Mario approaches the first red coin on the outside of the maze as before, and collects the next six red coins as described in a previous star. This time, instead of ground pounding the blue coin block, he jumps down, moves back slightly and kicks the wall in front of the eighth and final red coin, spawning the red coin star with his backwards velocity intact. After the cutscene, Mario falls down backwards and collects the star. Castle Upstairs (8) Mario long jumps thrice towards the 70 star door and enters it as normal, then BLJing up the stairs leading to  Bowser in the Sky  and clipping into the course entrance. Bowser in the Sky (with red coins) Mario starts with two long jumps and then triple jumps up to the first red coin, slightly straining backwards to reach it. After diving down, he long jumps and then dives and recovers from falling off of the bended tilting platform in front, jump diving and rapidly diving into the steep floor and then double jumping towards the rotating platform to his left, wall kicking off of it with a dive. Dive recovering, he lands on the second red coin and quickly dives and dive recovers down to the third red coin by the small ledge; then diving, dive recovering, side flipping and wall kicking up to the vertically rotating platforms with the 1-up mushroom. On these, Mario side flips again and wall kicks on a left platform as it moves down up to the block switch, dive grinding on the side of the retracting stairs with jump dives to bypass the switch. At the top, he jump dives twice up the steep floors while avoiding the fire, jumping to collect the fourth red coin. After this, Mario performs a pause-buffered BLJ on another steep floor to skip the horizontally moving elevator and collect the fifth red coin, then stopping by the sixth red coin with kicks and triple jumping up to the pole, grabbing and then jumping off after climbing briefly while collecting the seventh red coin. After jump diving twice in a straight line, he reaches another two sets of rotating platforms, side flipping and wall kicking up to the highest one and BLJing (with some pause buffered) to clip into the eighth red coin and spawn its star. Once spawned, Mario side flips to his right, jump dives and dives on the pipe into the star and collects it, then turns around, double jumps and dives into the pipe to fight Bowser for the final time. Final Bowser Fight Mario immediately double jumps over Bowser, grabbing him and throwing the first time. This process is repeated as soon as he gets up for the second throw. For the final throw, Mario side flips and grabs him as the parts of the arena around the edge fall, throwing him for the third time and defeating him. The  grand star  spawns, and Mario dives into it, ending the game with all 120 stars.

{"prompt": "Explain Yellow Coin", "completion": "Yellow Coin Technical Constants Object Group Level Tangibility Radius 1000 Draw Distance 4000 Hitbox Interaction Type Coin Radius 100 Height 64 Down Offset 0 Yellow Coins  are  objects  found in every level. When Mario interacts with a yellow coin, the  coin counter  increases,  Mario  is healed, and the coin unloads. When the coin counter reaches 100 while in one of the 15  courses , a  100 Coin Star  spawns above  Mario . The amount that the coin counter increases and the amount that Mario is healed is determined by the coin's value, which is 1, 2, or 5 for yellow, red, and blue coins, respectively. Some yellow coins are spawned by  Coin Spawners . Various glitches such as  cloning  and  Time Stop  can be used to spawn and collect more coins than there are intended to be in a level. Coin Duplication When Mario interacts with a coin, a flag is set which informs the coin to unload when it next updates. When the coin unloads, it marks itself as \"collected\" so that it does not spawn again when Mario leaves the area and returns. Using  cloning  or  Time Stop , we can prevent the coin from updating, and thus collect it without the coin being marked as \"collected\". This allows us to spawn the coin again, even after collecting it, effectively duplicating the coin. In this way it is possible to collect more than the normal number of coins in a level. In several levels, it is possible to increase the coin counter to 999. However, when using  cloning  by itself, each duplicated coin takes up an  object slot  in memory. There are only 240 object slots total, and attempting to spawn an additional object once all of them are full will cause the game to freeze.

{"prompt": "Explain Backwards Long Jump - Stair BLJ", "completion": "The  Backwards  Long Jump  hyperspeed method, or  BLJ  for short, is the most famous  hyperspeed  method in Super Mario 64. Due to their versatility, BLJs are commonly used in all kinds of  speedruns  and  challenges . When Mario initiates a long jump, his horizontal speed is multiplied by 3/2. A BLJ occurs when a backwards long jump is interrupted before the effects of drag can counteract the speed gain from the 3/2 multiplier. This does not occur with forwards long jumps because long jumps have a \"hard cap\" of +48 horizontal speed which Mario's speed cannot exceed. No such cap exists in the negative direction because normally the \"soft cap\" of -16 speed from drag is easily enough to stop any speed gain. There are several different types of BLJs. The distinguishing feature of different types of BLJs is what they use to interrupt the long jump: Slope BLJs use slopes by going up the slope. Stair BLJs use stairs by going up the stairs. Elevator BLJs use the upwards movement of an elevator or other object. Side BLJs  use two floors at slightly different levels by oscillating between them. Ceiling BLJs use an exposed ceiling or low-hanging ceiling by making Mario hit his head and start travelling downwards faster. BLJs can also be  pause buffered  to increase the amount of long jumps that can be performed in a given amount of time or space. The BLJ glitch was patched in the  Shindou release , and therefore also the  iQue version . This also means that any emulator releases of these game versions lack the BLJ glitch, namely the  Japanese Wii VC release , the  Japanese Wii U VC release , and all versions of  Super Mario 3D All-Stars . Contents 1   Slope BLJ 2   Stair BLJ 3   Elevator BLJ 4   Side BLJ 5   Ceiling BLJ Slope BLJ A slope BLJ is performed by interrupting a backwards long jump using a rising slope. Because Mario usually lands immediately after long jumping (assuming a steep enough slope), slope BLJs are normally pause bufferable. Stair BLJ A stair BLJ is similar to a slope BLJ, except using stairs instead of slopes to achieve the rising floor effect. Stair BLJs often cannot be performed when there are wall hitboxes sticking out from the stairs because the walls prevent Mario from landing on the higher floor. Similarly to slope BLJs, stair BLJs are often pause bufferable. Stair BLJs are often used for bypassing doors in the castle. Elevator BLJ Elevator BLJs are also conceptually similar to slope BLJs and stair BLJs in that they too use the floor under Mario rising to interrupt Mario's long jump. Elevator BLJs use elevators as the rising floor. Elevator BLJs are a common solution for when one wishes to quickly get a lot of speed since while slope BLJs and stair BLJs can only last until the slope or stair runs out or Mario hits out-of-bounds, elevator BLJs can last as long as the elevator is moving and don't need to stop when Mario hits out-of-bounds. Because of this, elevator BLJs are the only type of BLJ that can reach  PU  speed. Side BLJ Side BLJs or SBLJs are the most complex type of BLJ. A side BLJ is performed by oscillating between two floors at slightly different heights to achieve an effect similar to a stair BLJ but without needing a long, wall-less staircase. Side BLJs are performed by first having Mario face slightly to the higher floor (so that when Mario's moving backwards, he moves down to the lower floor), then straining to the higher floor during the long jump so that Mario snaps up to it. After long jumping from the lower floor, Mario ends up on the higher floor due to the straining, but because of the direction Mario is facing he snaps down to the lower floor on the next frame. This can then be repeated. Because side BLJs require 1 extra frame per long jump for Mario to snap back down to the lower floor, they cannot be pause buffered. Ceiling BLJ A ceiling BLJ is performed by having Mario hit a ceiling during his long jumps so that Mario starts moving downwards earlier, meaning there's less time for drag to slow Mario down. Ceiling BLJs can be performed with low ceilings or with  exposed ceilings .  Lobby Backwards Long Jump  is an example of this type of BLJ. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp"}

It was a launch title for the N64 (along with  Pilotwings 64  and  Cruis'n USA  in Europe), and is largely considered to be one of the most important 3D platformers of all time.

The first time  Super Mario 64  was shown was at the  Shoshinkai show in November of 1995 , with the introduction of the Nintendo 64 (Ultra 64 at the time). Early footage of the show revealed the 50% complete beta version of  Super Mario 64 , in which it looked completely different than what the final product looked like. [1]  The final product was supposed to come out in December, but it was delayed further, and the entire game was rebuilt. On May 16th, 1996 (E3 1996) the game was shown off and is almost like the final game. [2]  The entire game was almost accessible, some details got changed before the release, such as the different star icon in the HUD, a rock spike at the top of the mountain in  Bob-omb Battlefield , and other small details that were changed. The game was rushed at the end of development as told by one of the programmers of  Super Mario 64 , and a couple of the team members never wanted to make games anymore due to being burnt out after working on  Super Mario 64 . [3]  The game was released in Japan on June 23rd 1996, then on September 29th, 1996 in North America, and finally on March 1st, 1997 in Europe. Game Versions There are many different versions of the game, differing by where, when, how, and in what way they were released. N64 The Nintendo 64 console is less robust than modern consoles, so its CPU is more likely to crash when confronted by errors and other unforeseen occurrences. Japanese The very first version of the game to be commercially released, the Japanese N64 version was succeeded by the  Shindou  version a year after release. The Japanese version has a few glitches that were later fixed in all other versions, such as  spawning displacement ,  the lack of a coin limit ,  time stop  and others. It is also notable for being the fastest version of the game for the  1 Key  category (and some others). This is because the text takes longer, but the lack of narration makes the game shorter. The text in the first Bowser fight is avoided during the 1 Key run, so the Japanese version becomes faster. English See also:  Version Differences The English version and all successive versions added some extra dialogue over the Japanese version. For example, Mario does not say \"Haha\", and Peach does not narrate her \"Dear Mario\" letter. In addition, she does not talk during the ending. It fixes some errors and glitches from the previous version, such as the lack of a coin limit. It has, in general, less text than the Japanese version, but takes longer during the intro and ending due to Peach's narration. PAL The European release of  Super Mario 64  supports language changing in the settings menu between English, French, and German. This is optimal for the  ABZ Button Challenge  because the Start button can be used to change language and the language with the least text can be selected. Due to  Wii VC Round-To-Zero , however, the true optimal PAL version is not on N64. Outside of ABZ, PAL is little-used because changing languages wastes time and English is effectively identical if you do not change languages. Because of the PAL video format using 50hz instead of NTSC's 60hz, PAL runs at 25  frames  per second rather than 30, another reason why it is suboptimal for speedruns/TASes. Shindou The final release of  Super Mario 64  on the Nintendo 64 was once again released in Japanese. It enabled a compiler flag to allow optimizations, which results in less lag. It also fixed the infamous  Backwards Long Jump  glitch, which is why it is rarely used in speedruns, except in the  BLJless  category. Strangely, when grabbing a  pole  on this version, horizontal speed affects Mario's angle. The game introduced new voice clips like \"Bye, bye!\" when throwing Bowser. Some of Mario's voice clips are high-pitched in this version. This version would later be used for Super Mario 3D All-Stars. iQue (Chinese) Main article:  Super Mario 64 (iQue) The iQue version of the game runs on the iQue Player, a rare handheld N64 variant only released in China. The iQue version is in fact the Shindou version translated to Chinese, and as such it does not have BLJs or the Bob-omb or Bully angle crashes. By hacking a romhack by Kaze onto an iQue, it was found that the camera going to a  Parallel Universe  does crash the game like on the N64 console. [4] 64DD Version Super Mario 64  DD Version or SM64DD (called Super Mario Disk Version on the title screen) was an unreleased version of the game for the 64DD, likely made to test the load times of the system. The 64DD was a commercial failure, and the DD version was never released. Only one known copy of this version exists, owned by adonfjv, who found it at a Japanese video game store in 2014 [5] . The ROM (NDD) of this version has since been dumped. SM64DD is effectively the Japanese version of SM64 ported to the 64DD, with most (but not all) sounds replaced with their PAL versions. For example, the red coin and the sliding star door sounds are the same as in the Japanese release. The title screen is vastly different, resembling the hidden debug mode's level select screen. Since it is on a disk, load times are increased. The most major difference is that entering the inside of the island in  Tiny-Huge Island , where Wiggler and red coins reside, will crash the game. This makes collecting all 120 stars impossible on this version. The crash is console only, and occurs due to Wiggler's health value being uninitialized (the original Japanese and USA releases do not crash from this programming oversight as a coincidence). Wii VC Main article:  Virtual Console The Wii acts differently from the N64. It is much less likely to crash. Unlike the N64, it does not crash from  PU crashes ,   Bully angle crash , or Bob-omb angle crash. The emulation software also  rounds floats differently  from other consoles. Another difference is that it does not crash from the  Address Error Exception . It is currently unknown whether the Wii crashes upon having infinity speed. Japanese Japanese Wii VC is actually the Shindou edition, not the original Japanese version. This is why it does not have spawning displacement or other Japanese N64-exclusive glitches, nor does it have BLJs. It is almost never used for speedrunning for that reason. English English Wii VC is the optimal Wii VC for speedruns. It avoids the lack of BLJs in the Japanese version and the slower framerate of the PAL version. It is used for the  A Button Challenge  any% run because  Bowser in the Fire Sea  takes 0 A presses instead of 1 due to a rounding error. PAL PAL Wii VC is rarely seen because it is obscure and slow. However, it is actually the ideal game version for the ABZ Button Challenge, at least for any%, because it contains both language switching and the rounding error in BitFS. Wii U VC Main article:  Virtual Console The Wii U Virtual Console version has no known interesting glitches that set it apart from either N64 or Wii VC. It is identical to Wii VC, except that the rounding error is absent. Like Wii VC, it ignores  Address Error Exceptions . Wii U VC is often joked by speedrunners for have a high amount of input lag and it is mostly used only by new runners. Japanese Much like Wii VC, Japanese Wii U VC is the Shindou version. This means that BLJs and other glitches that were patched in the Shindou version are absent.  English Also like Wii VC, American Wii U VC is the US version. PAL PAL Wii U VC is actually the US version (unlike on Wii VC), so it's identical to the US Wii U VC. [6] Switch Super Mario 3D All-Stars Super Mario 3D All-Stars  includes an upscaled  Super Mario 64 . The version is the Shindou version with Lua scripts to hack in English text, new upscaled textures, and slight changes to accommodate the Switch control scheme (for example, \"PRESS +\" on the Mario head screen instead of \"PRESS START\"). [7]  The Switch does not have  the Wii's rounding error , but it does ignore  Address Error Exceptions . Nintendo Switch Online Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack includes  Super Mario 64  as part of the Nintendo 64 emulated games. Unlike  Super Mario 3D All-Stars , the Nintendo Switch Online version still has BLJs. [8] Super Mario 64 DS Main article:  Super Mario 64 DS Super Mario 64 DS  is a remake of  Super Mario 64  for the DS. Its physics are vastly different and there is no evidence that it shares any code with the original N64 release but may very likely have used the original N64 models for levels and areas; therefore it is not usually considered a \"version\" of  Super Mario 64 , but rather a rerelease. It has 150 stars instead of the original's 120, more powerups, different playable characters with different special abilities, and more.

{"prompt": "Explain HP", "completion": "HP  (also known as  Health ) is the measure of  Mario\u2019s  health. If this reaches 0, Mario loses a life. The variable that represents Mario\u2019s HP is a short, which ranges from 0 to 2176 (or 0x0000 to 0x0880 in hexadecimal). Specifically, the upper byte represents how many full sectors of health Mario has, and the lower byte represents what portion of the next sector Mario has. Thus, one sector is equivalent to 256 HP units. The number of sectors displayed is the truncated version of the actual number of sectors. The maximum health is 2176 HP units (8.5 sectors). Mario will die if he goes below 256 HP units (1 sector). The HP variable is signed, so even if there was a way to push it below 0, it would not wrap around to 65535. Instead, the value would have to be pushed below -32768 to wrap it around to 32767. However, if HP is above 2176, it will just get set to 2176.  Contents 1   INC and DEC 2   Gaining Health 3   Losing Health 3.1   Enemies 3.2   Environment 4   References INC and DEC There are two bytes related to health: the increase counter and the decrease counter. When Mario gains or loses an integer number of health sectors, it\u2019s these counters that manage that. Specifically, these counters specify how many increments of 64 HP units (one quarter sector) Mario should gain or lose. For example, if Mario touches a  goomba , the decrease counter increases to 4. Thus, over the next 4 frames, Mario will lose 64 HP units on each frame, resulting in one full health sector lost. Once Mario's HP goes below 256 (1 sector), then he's dead, and there's no way to restore HP at that point. Mario can still collect  coins  to increase the INC counter, but the INC and DEC counters no longer function. For example, if Mario has 255 HP and collects a yellow coin, then INC will increase from 0 to 4, but it will just stay at 4 while Mario does the dying animation.  Separately, there are many things that change Mario\u2019s HP directly, rather than going through the counter system. These include being underwater, being at the surface of  water , being in cold water, being in toxic gas, and being burned by fire. Additionally, there are some things that set Mario\u2019s HP to a particular value. These include being eaten by  Bubba , dying, selecting a save file, and letting the demo play.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Whomp's Fortress)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves.

They try to pick up Mario, and after doing so, spin around and then throw him. They do not directly damage Mario, but can throw him into the death barrier or cause fall damage if they throw him off a ledge. Mario can defeat them by picking them up and throwing them onto the ground. Contents 1   Locations 2   Escaping Chuckya 3   Behavior 3.1   Moving 3.2   Throwing 4   References Locations The following courses have Chuckyas: Wet-Dry World Tall, Tall Mountain Tiny-Huge Island Rainbow Ride Bowser in the Sky Escaping Chuckya When Chuckya grabs Mario a counter is initialized that lets Mario escape from Chuckya if it reaches 11. The counter starts at zero, and increases by one every time the player presses the A button or moves the joystick from the inside to the outside of its radius. [3]  This is possible to do 1.5 times per frame with  pause buffering . Behavior Moving Through all movement, Chuckya accelerates at a rate of 4 units/f 2  up to a maximum of 30 units/f and slows down at the same rate. Chuckya's movement is composed of three different steps, which loop over and over again: Chuckya turns towards Mario in increment of maximum 1024 angular units until he is less than 4096 horizontal angular units in front of him or for 41 frames, whichever happens first Even if Mario is already within 4096 angular units, Chuckya will turn for at least one frame toward Mario and will stop early if it reaches exactly 0 angular units If Mario is in less than 2000 units laterally from Chuckya's home, Chuckya will chase forwards until Mario is behind a line perpendicular to Chuckya's forward direction If Mario is more than 2000 units away from the home, Chuckya will turn back and move toward its home, modifying its speed until it reaches 10 speed, until it is within 500 units laterally, afterwhich it will instantly stop and wait for Mario to be within 1900 units of the home to turn again Chuckya will stop for 48 frames Due to the way the engine functions, Chuckya's position will not be updated if Mario is more than 4000 units away from it, but its angle and speed will still update This behavior is exploited in the  A Button Challenge  to have Chuckya drop at the start of the stage in Bowser in the Sky [4] Throwing When Chuckya grabs Mario, a random number between 10 and 40 is generated to serve as a timer. Every frame, Chuckya will rotate by 2048 horizontal angular units counterclockwise and the timer is decreased by 1. If Mario does not escape, he will be thrown when the timer is less than 0 and one of the following conditions is met:  There is a floor no more than 50 units below a point 150 units in front of Chuckya The timer reaches -17 Once one of those conditions is met, Chuckya will throw Mario at its anchor point (Similar to Mario's  HOLP ). This anchor point is only updated when Chuckya is rendered, which opens itself to  Chuckya Wrong Throw .

{"prompt": "Explain Surface - Floors", "completion": "A  surface  or  triangle  in Super Mario 64 is a piece of geometry that exerts some kind of force or effect on Mario. Every triangle falls into one of three categories: a floor triangle, a wall triangle, or a ceiling triangle. However, a triangle does not store what category it is. Instead, its category is determined based on the y component of the triangle's  normal vector [1] . If y component > 0.01, then it is a floor. If y component < -0.01, then it is a ceiling. Otherwise, it is a wall. Contents 1   Walls 1.1   Hitbox 1.2   Non-vertical walls 2   Floors 2.1   Hitbox 3   Ceilings 4   Surface Types 5   References Walls A triangle is a wall triangle if and only if -0.01 < normal.y < 0.01. Hitbox   The hitbox of a wall during both the initial handle and a ground quarter step, simplified   The hitbox of a wall during an air quarter step, simplified   The hitbox of a wall in the water, including both the inital handle and the single frame movement, simplified All wall hitboxes are handled once per  frame  and once per  quarter step  of Mario's movement. Most of the time, a wall has two separate hitboxes handled one after the other within a frame or quarter step. A wall hitbox's initial frame handle has a hitbox extending 50  units  forward and 50 units backward, offset down 60, and then a hitbox extending 24 units in each direction offset down 30. A quarter step of ground movement has a hitbox extending 24  units  forward and 24 units backward, offset down 30, and then a hitbox extending 50 units in each direction offset down 60. This is the opposite order from the initial handle, but the outcome is the same. A quarter step of air movement gives the wall a hitbox of 50 units in each direction offset down 150, and then a hitbox of 50 units offset down 30. Water movement does not implement quarter steps. After one frame of water movement, a wall hitbox extends 110 units in each direction, offset down 10. Since both the water handle and the initial handle both happen once per frame, the hitboxes can be overlaid. Non-vertical walls   This wall in  BoB  is not quite vertical.  The majority of walls in the game are perfectly vertical, but not all. Walls that are not vertical are one cause of  Glitchy Ledge Grabs . Floors A floor triangle is a triangle with normal.y > 0.01. Hitbox A floor's hitbox extends 78 units below and 100 units above the floor triangle. This allows Mario to move vertically along floors; if he is moving up or down a slope or stairs, he will be off the floor after his horizontal motion but still in its hitbox, which will snap him to the floor. He will always be snapped up if he's in a floor's hitbox below the floor, but he'll only be snapped down while above a floor if he is in a ground movement state. When walking on a slope, Mario will move horizontally at a rate slower than his actual speed, known as his  De Facto Speed . Any location that is not inside or above a floor hitbox is considered out of bounds; Mario will not be able to move into it of his own volition, and if forced into it, he will die. Ceilings A ceiling hitbox extends from 160 units below the ceiling to infinitely above. For ground and air movement, the ceiling will try its best to keep Mario out of it. If Mario walks into the ceiling, his quarter step will be canceled, and he will remain in place and do the pushing animation. If Mario is moving upwards in the air when coming in contact with the ceiling, his quarter step will be canceled and his vertical speed will be set to 0. On the contrary, when Mario falls onto a ceiling while airborne, his quarter step will be canceled and his horizontal speed will get set to 0, making him fall straight down. Although a ceiling will extend upwards infinitely, a floor can overwrite the ceiling hitbox, meaning that its hitbox will stop right when the floor hitbox starts. On the American release of the game, there is an interesting ceiling example found in  Rainbow Ride , where  the top of the chimney is not capped off , making the ceiling go up forever, softlocking Mario if he ends up sliding into it. Even though ceilings try to push Mario outwards, they can still be accessed using various techniques, such as getting pushed by an enemy. Note that once Mario is standing inside the ceiling, he is no longer able to move anywhere due to his quarter steps being cancelled.  For Water movement, Mario instead gets warped downward by ceilings. These downwarps are used in various TASes and speedruns. Surface Types While the surface type of a surface is not restricted to only floors, walls, or ceilings, in practice they are only used in certain scenarios, or wouldn't have any affect if such surface was of a different type, i.e. there could be a vertical wind ceiling or a death barrier wall, but those surfaces would have the behaviour.

{"prompt": "Explain Seesaw platforms", "completion": "Seesaw Platform Technical Constants Object Group Surface Actor Group N/A Seesaw Platforms are objects that Mario can stand on which move downward around a pivot while he is on them. When Mario gets off them, they rotate back to the horizontal position. There are 7 varieties throughout the game. Behavior If the seesaw platform is the S-shaped one in Bowser in the Sky, then its collision distance is increased to 2000 since it is larger. The seesaw platform\u2019s facing pitch angle is increased by the value of its pitch velocity every frame it is updated. If its pitch velocity is above 10 units/frame, a sound is played. If Mario is on the platform, a rotation value is stored as the distance from the platform object to Mario times the cosine of the difference between the angle to Mario and the yaw angle. If the platform is decelerating, this rotation value is multiplied by .04, otherwise it is multiplied by .02. The value of the platform\u2019s pitch velocity is then increased by the rotation value every frame. The platform\u2019s pitch velocity cannot be less than -50 units/frame or greater than 50 units/frame. If Mario is not on the object, it oscillates back toward the horizontal.

If you land at an angle or with tons of speed it is easy to miss a secret. Sometimes (more commonly on the Japanese version), the camera will get stuck in \"flight mode\" while Mario is no longer flying. This can happen if your flight is interrupted too quickly (if you dive too late or if you get caught sliding on the fence). You can also reset the camera to normal by getting hit by an enemy or starting to fly again and then stopping (e.g. by groundpounding once you are flying). Examples   To avoid a stored angle,  hold neutral  when landing. The angle you're holding when you land from flying is stored for the next time you fly Load video Local File Local File might collect personal data.

You can perform a backflip by pressing and holding Z and pressing A. Holding forwards during the backflip can cause Mario to have a net forwards movement. The  Vertical Speed  (VS) value that a backflip starts with is 62. With all of the vertical speed combined, you can get 512 units up from where you started the backflip. Transition In See  single jump  for more details Mario's current animation is stopped. Mario's forward velocity is set to -16 Mario's vertical speed is set to 62 Behavior Certain things here are more explained on their individual pages. If something lacks detail, check the link for more information. As with all airborne actions, a variety of \"cancels\" are checked prior to actually performing the jump action. These checks are as follows: Water - If Mario's height is lower than 100 units below the water height, the action is transitioned into the  water plunge  action. Squish - If Mario is supposed to be squished, his action is changed to the  squished  action. Vertical Wind- If Mario is above a vertical wind floor, his action is changed to the  vertical wind  action. (This is due to the jump action having the \"Allow Vertical Wind Action\" flag.) At this point, two more things happen prior to the backflip action: Mario's quicksand depth is set to 0. Mario plays a falling noise if he has fallen more than 1150 units from his peak. With the backflip action occurring now, the following happens:  If the Z button is pressed, Mario will enter the  Ground Pound  action. This stops the backflip action. Mario performs his noise for the backflip. Now, Mario performs the quarter-frame movement via a full  common air step . The landing action is a  backflip land  action. Both the check for hanging and ledge grabbing are not present for this step. The backflip swoosh sounds are played last.

{"prompt": "Explain Backwards Long Jump", "completion": "The  Backwards  Long Jump  hyperspeed method, or  BLJ  for short, is the most famous  hyperspeed  method in Super Mario 64. Due to their versatility, BLJs are commonly used in all kinds of  speedruns  and  challenges . When Mario initiates a long jump, his horizontal speed is multiplied by 3/2. A BLJ occurs when a backwards long jump is interrupted before the effects of drag can counteract the speed gain from the 3/2 multiplier. This does not occur with forwards long jumps because long jumps have a \"hard cap\" of +48 horizontal speed which Mario's speed cannot exceed. No such cap exists in the negative direction because normally the \"soft cap\" of -16 speed from drag is easily enough to stop any speed gain. There are several different types of BLJs. The distinguishing feature of different types of BLJs is what they use to interrupt the long jump: Slope BLJs use slopes by going up the slope. Stair BLJs use stairs by going up the stairs. Elevator BLJs use the upwards movement of an elevator or other object. Side BLJs  use two floors at slightly different levels by oscillating between them. Ceiling BLJs use an exposed ceiling or low-hanging ceiling by making Mario hit his head and start travelling downwards faster. BLJs can also be  pause buffered  to increase the amount of long jumps that can be performed in a given amount of time or space. The BLJ glitch was patched in the  Shindou release , and therefore also the  iQue version . This also means that any emulator releases of these game versions lack the BLJ glitch, namely the  Japanese Wii VC release , the  Japanese Wii U VC release , and all versions of  Super Mario 3D All-Stars . Contents 1   Slope BLJ 2   Stair BLJ 3   Elevator BLJ 4   Side BLJ 5   Ceiling BLJ Slope BLJ A slope BLJ is performed by interrupting a backwards long jump using a rising slope. Because Mario usually lands immediately after long jumping (assuming a steep enough slope), slope BLJs are normally pause bufferable. Stair BLJ A stair BLJ is similar to a slope BLJ, except using stairs instead of slopes to achieve the rising floor effect. Stair BLJs often cannot be performed when there are wall hitboxes sticking out from the stairs because the walls prevent Mario from landing on the higher floor. Similarly to slope BLJs, stair BLJs are often pause bufferable. Stair BLJs are often used for bypassing doors in the castle. Elevator BLJ Elevator BLJs are also conceptually similar to slope BLJs and stair BLJs in that they too use the floor under Mario rising to interrupt Mario's long jump. Elevator BLJs use elevators as the rising floor. Elevator BLJs are a common solution for when one wishes to quickly get a lot of speed since while slope BLJs and stair BLJs can only last until the slope or stair runs out or Mario hits out-of-bounds, elevator BLJs can last as long as the elevator is moving and don't need to stop when Mario hits out-of-bounds. Because of this, elevator BLJs are the only type of BLJ that can reach  PU  speed. Side BLJ Side BLJs or SBLJs are the most complex type of BLJ. A side BLJ is performed by oscillating between two floors at slightly different heights to achieve an effect similar to a stair BLJ but without needing a long, wall-less staircase. Side BLJs are performed by first having Mario face slightly to the higher floor (so that when Mario's moving backwards, he moves down to the lower floor), then straining to the higher floor during the long jump so that Mario snaps up to it. After long jumping from the lower floor, Mario ends up on the higher floor due to the straining, but because of the direction Mario is facing he snaps down to the lower floor on the next frame. This can then be repeated. Because side BLJs require 1 extra frame per long jump for Mario to snap back down to the lower floor, they cannot be pause buffered. Ceiling BLJ A ceiling BLJ is performed by having Mario hit a ceiling during his long jumps so that Mario starts moving downwards earlier, meaning there's less time for drag to slow Mario down. Ceiling BLJs can be performed with low ceilings or with  exposed ceilings .  Lobby Backwards Long Jump  is an example of this type of BLJ. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp"}

The level can be beaten with or without a preset  HOLP , and is faster with that HOLP. However, both known methods of achieving this HOLP are not possible more than once without incurring additional A presses or using more time than they save. ABC Strategy The beginning of the level is the hardest part. It contains several subsequent platforms that are too high to get over without an A press and almost nothing to work with. Luckily, when the  207 DR  technique was discovered, which utilizes a  misalignment  to get extra height, all of the initial platforms except the last became passable. Then, a technique called the  Chuckya Drop  was discovered that uses manipulation to get  Chuckya  to fall from above [1] . Without Preset HOLP Leaving Chuckya behind, Mario rapidly climbs the rest of the level, using the  messed-up axle location  to cross the elevator. When he reaches the area past the arrow platform, he uses  cloning  to build a  Goomba ladder . When it is finished, Mario falls down back to the start of the level. Mario actually carries Chuckya with him for a time save later [2] , making heavy use of  Light Chuckya via Edge  to carry him quickly and with mobility. To cross gaps,  butt bounces  and  slide kicks  followed by getting thrown can be used. To cross the elevator, the messed-up axle location combined with a Chuckya throw and floor clip are used. The next gap can be crossed by throwing heavy Chuckya and being grabbed. By grinding, Chuckya can be brought onto the arrow platform. He can then throw Mario back to the checkered area. Chuckya will squeeze under the wooden obstacles as long as Mario stands on the arrow platform to lower it. With  Goomba  bounces and a perfectly-timed Chuckya throw, 13 Goomba clones are made unnecessary, leaving only 21. With Preset HOLP Setting the HOLP The necessary HOLP can be set in either  Bowser in the Fire Sea ,  Rainbow Ride , or  Bob-omb Battlefield . BitFS The necessary HOLP is just above the area with the  Bob-omb . Mario first uses the Bob-omb to set the HOLP directly under the needed HOLP. He then clones a  fire  from one of the  fire spitters , using  Pause Buffered Hitstun  (PBH) from an  explosion  clone to release it without updating the HOLP, and it releases at Mario's current height, which is at the intended HOLP. Mario then glides through the air using a  bloated Bob-omb , which he immediately releases upon touching the fire clone. He then proceeds to defeat  Bowser  by using PBH to throw him, which still causes him to appear in front of Bowser due to a quirk in Bowser's code. Then, no stars upstairs may modify the HOLP. This makes this method of setting the HOLP viable only for the any% run [3] . RR First, a Bob-omb must be brought up to the top of the big house. This is more difficult than it sounds due to complicated  handsfree teleport  techniques and branches off the strat for  the big house 0x . Mario then  frame walks  up a spire, slides down, and throws the Bob-omb in midair at the required HOLP location. He lands near the red coin star area, so he can collect the  100 coin star  (because he collected all of the big house coins) and then the  red coin star [4] . BoB This is done with a  Goomba staircase . [5] In BitS Mario crosses the elevator using the messed-up axle location as normal. When he passes the arrow platform, he uses  Pause Buffered Hitstun  from taking huge  fall damage  to throw a fire clone at the HOLP, which is on top of a pole. There are two possible poles that can be used for this. The larger of the two requires bouncing on a nearby Goomba. Once done, simple Goomba bounces and messed-up axle location uses allow Mario to reach the pipe, which he enters using a  207 DR . Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , the Grand Star can be collected. It can also be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , both the regular star and Grand Star can be collected. Neither the Grand Star nor the regular star can be collected in the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge  or  No Joystick Allowed Challenge . In the  Pacifist Challenge , both the regular star and Grand Star can be collected, as  Bowser  is an exception to the pacifist rule. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 3 B presses, to grab Bowser 3 times. B does not need to be pressed to release Bowser, since Mario can just drop him into a mine for the first two hits and get burned while swinging him around to throw him at high speed for the third hit. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge , the Grand Star can be collected. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: killing the  Mystery Goomba  and collecting its coin, reaching a  Parallel Universe  in both areas of the level, and defeating Bowser without swinging him. Mystery Goomba Main article:  Mystery Goomba All Goombas in the game fall into one of two categories:  singleton  or  triangle . Triangle Goombas have an object called a  Goomba Spawner  which loads and unloads them as Mario gets close. However, in Bowser in the Sky, there is a set of only two Goombas, which is actually a set of three triangle Goombas of which one instantly unloads. This one is called the Mystery Goomba, and there is no known way to kill him.

The current route begins by heading the normal direction most players would, but triple jumps into the corner below and to the right of  Roll into the Cage . This is followed by two normal wall kicks, and then a  glitchy wall kick  to keep the same direction to dive towards the  Get a Hand star  cubby. After landing in the cubby, a long jump into a wall kick is done immediately to reach the  cog  for another wall kick. Worth noting, this cog position is where it is due to the random setting cog of the clock, which therefore requires  RNG . This forces precise work to have it in the needed range. Wall kicking off the cog, there is a precise wall kick off the cage around the Roll into the Cage star to get on top. Upon landing, another long jump into a wall kick is executed, which leads into another glitchy wall kick. The glitchy wall kick provides a better angle to be able to jump off the  pendulum  (which is also where it is due to RNG). This jump off the pendulum is led into by a speed kick-double jump combo that allows the jump off the pendulum to be a triple jump. This triple leads into yet another wall kick that lands on the cage beneath  Timed Jumps on Moving Bars . Upon landing, a sideflip into a wall kick allows Mario to land above the Timed Jumps on Moving Bars star. A creative long jump into the exclamation block here allows two wall kicks that give enough height to land on the walkway that leads to the higher hand. After following the path to the area below the Stomp on the Thwomp star, an unorthodox triple jump into a well placed wall kick allows Mario to land on the treadmill. This is enough height to sideflip onto the thwomp, and single jump into the star. The improvements to this route supposedly came in the form of small improvements (which happens in the case of most time saves) and better RNG. RNG is logical as this route has mario interacting with two  treadmills , a pendulum, the  thwomp , and a very specific wall kick of a cog. ABC WR History Stomp on the Thwomp has been known as a difficult star for the A button challenge for a long time, and for this reason it is often excluded from early lists. bobmario511 was the first known person to route and perform a TAS for the star, producing 4 over a period of one month. Having gotten the count to 15 presses, bobmario511 was fairly certain the route was maxed, and felt comfortable with the TAS. Since this point, pannenkoek2012 and the rest of the ABC team have worked to improve this star, and have saved 13 A Presses. Stomp on the Thwomp in particular takes a lot of creative routing and problem solving, and combining these in a creative way to save A presses. In general, the routing usually focuses on efficient usage the two available bob-ombs, their two coins, the one-time pre-set HOLP, and the 100 coin star for a  Star Dance Clip  (SDC).

[38] Oct 18, 2018 2 [39] 1 pannenkoek2012 Random Utilized VSC from the pedro box spot onto the clock hand to reach the thwomp. [40] Current ABC Route Because of the nature of TTC and how it's nearly a completely different course depending on the clock setting, the route has continually changed different settings. The current route is on the  random  setting. Prior to even entering TTC, a  HOLP  is set in  BitS  that will later be utilized near the  pendulum box   Pedro Spot . Getting to the second level of the clock (by the first clock hand) cannot be done going through the main pathway without pressing A. This is avoided by using the  spinners , instead. So with this in mind, the current route goes up these spinners every time it needs to go up to the second level. At the second level, getting onto the area with the  cogs  is a more difficult task and requires using a  star dance clip  (SDC) via a  100 coin star  to get past. This is an issue here, though, as Mario only has access to 36 coins from the second level down. Luckily, this can be overcome using  cloning  and the line of coins along the higher pole. Not so luckily, this means having to navigate the spinners on the random setting while carrying a  bob-omb  64 times. This is an incredibly time consuming and monotonous task, and takes roughly 20 minutes per coin. [41]  For this reason, work is usually done to avoid redoing the cloning, typically by just setting a different HOLP and reusing the old first section of the TAS. Since this cloning will update the HOLP, a bob-omb is thrown first to the HOLP via  Pause Buffered Hitstun  for later usage. Once all 64 coins have been cloned, another clone must be used to place a  fire  clone before the ledge leading to the cogs. A single SDC is not enough height to reach the ledge, but a fire burn into a SDC is. To avoid immediately burning on the fire clone, it is placed carefully using the hand to push Mario out of the way. [42]  With the fire clone set, the\u00a0! block containing three coins above the second is broken, and one of the coins is cloned. This allows the 100 coin star to be placed in a spot that allows the SDC without needing a bob-omb to still have its coin. At this point, the set-up is complete and Mario can now burn and clip up to the area near the cogs.   The pendulum box pedro spot. Now with access to the cogs, Mario can simply dive recover until he reaches the top. At this point, a special maneuver termed \" Cog Misa \" is utilized. Mario conserve vertical speed onto the highest cog using one of the cog's  misalignments , allowing him to reach the walkway to  Roll into the Cage  (which normally is too high to reach without an A press). This misalignment was thought to be impossible, as setting the cog's (very slightly) longest edge face as close to mario as possible, while still facing away from the origin to keep its misalignment open, was not enough for Mario to avoid the protruding wall hitboxes in the way of reaching the misalignment. However, if the cog was turned even closer towards mario 1 frame before he reaches the misalignment, where maximum cog spinning speed can let the cog barely reach the point when the misalignment opens up, Mario can dive recover at a sharper angle, and use the misalignmentless wall hitbox to get pushed rightwards by the spinning cog, so on the next frame, when the cog's misalignment finally opens, Mario can enter the misalignment with his better facing angle and extreme leftwards straining.  [38]  This maneuver allows Mario to get past the cogs without any presses, something that required a bob-omb and the HOLP prior to this maneuver. Near Roll into the Cage, Mario now uses  hyperspeed grinding  to build up speed in the \"Sidney Spot\". [43]  This essentially works by repeatably falling and landing, which can gain speed over time via air movement. Once Mario has enough speed, he can jump out of the spot, converting his horizontal speed to vertical speed, allowing him to land in the area near the  The Pit and the Pendulums  star. This is the first A press. From here, Mario makes his way to the Pit and the Pendulums area where the back pendulum is  manipulated  via  RNG . This eventually increases the magnitude of the arm movement enough to allow Mario be able to ride up the arm to get close to a  pedro spot  that is located above the pendulum box in the corners. [44]  Having ridden the arm into a relatively close position, Mario is pushed into the  ceiling  by the pendulum arm. The bob-omb that was thrown earlier drops onto Mario from above, knocking him onto the box. Finally, the pendulum arm pushes him into position in the pedro spot. From this spot, Mario manipulates the RNG to be in good condition for a later part of the TAS.  Mario now is able to build up large amounts of speed in this position (roughly 680), despite having to occasionally sacrifice speed to avoid the pendulum arm. Once he has enough speed, Mario jumps out of the spot by landing on the pendulum arm. Jumping converts the horizontal speed to vertical speed, giving Mario massive amounts of upwards mobility. (This is the second press). This speed is immediately conserved by landing on the floor directly about the spot. From here, Mario punches to the edge of the cage. At this point, all Mario needs to do is wait for the upper hand to get into position to land on. Once it is Mario falls off, using the upwards speed to navigate onto the upper clock hand and landing with C^ to  conserve his vertical speed . Once on the hand, the hand ticks counter clockwise to the right side of the treadmill. This is a fairly uncommon occurrence- the hand ticks clockwise three times as often as counter clockwise, and has ticks three times as large. This rare situation is why the RNG manipulation on the pendulum box was important. Once the hand is near the  treadmill , Mario punches off the hand and lands on the  Thwomp . From here, grabbing the star only requires a dive recover. Obsoleted Still Setting Route   The pedro spot and angle used for the x5 still method. Prior to even entering TTC, a  HOLP  is set in  TTM . After entering the course, the first thing done is to instant release a bob-omb at the HOLP which will later be utilized in the cog area of the clock.  Gaining height on the still setting is harder than on the moving settings, primarily due to being unable to go up the spinner side and instead having to go up the rotating block main pathway. Getting past the first rotating cube requires a jump dive, this is the first A press. Clearing the next set of rotating blocks requires a well placed double jump into triple jump dive combo. The dive lands on the moving bar so Mario can dive recover onto the second level. These are the second and third A presses. From here, Mario reactivates the bob-omb placed at the HOLP, which snaps to Mario since it is out of bounds. Now with the bob-omb present, jump dive transports both it and Mario to the pathway before the cogs. This is the fourth A press. Finally at the cogs, Mario can use the bob-omb to push himself into the cog pedro spot with a precise location and angle. After building up enough speed, Mario jump dives straight to the top of the thwomp, from where he can dive recover into the star. The jump to the thwomp is the fifth A press. Potential ABC Improvements Random Cog Pedro Spot Main article:  Random Cog Pedro Spot There is a known pedro spot that is used in the still-setting world record in between the first two cogs while they are still. This pedro spot also exists on the moving clock settings, and has potential usage on the random setting. A route with the pedro spot on random would combine most of the positives of both current world records- it would be able to go up the spinners and SDC onto the cog area while also jumping up to the higher area with the thwomp. Depending on how ideal of an angle is used, it could either allow Stomp on the Thwomp to drop to either one or two A presses. [45] Initially, pannenkoek did calculations for the viability of this strategy, and came up with astronomically small likelihoods of success. This was due to needing roughly 1200 consecutive frames with calls, all with a one in seven chance. The strat was essentially declared dead at this point, and ruled as infeasible. [46]  About a year later, Iwer Sonsch brought up the point that through small angle oscillations, Mario can stay in the pedro spot with less RNG calls. These small angles gradually grow over time (since Mario's speed is growing as well) and allow largely and larger angle oscillations until the spot becomes stable. This managed to drop the total from around 1200 RNG calls to about 80 or so. The analysis also showed that there was more than just one route (completely still) to work with, which opened other opportunities to aim for to increase the likelihood of there being a configuration that works. [47]  Additionally since the release of pannenkoek's video, pendulum manipulation was discovered. This technique opens an incredibly large number of possible TTC states, magnitudes greater than what earlier calculations used giving the strategy even greater potential odds.

{"prompt": "Explain Bowser key", "completion": "Bowser key Hitbox Info Hitbox cylinder with radius of 80 and height of 50, offset down 0 units Tangibility radius 1000 Interaction type Star/Key Surfaces none Related Power Star Found In Bowser Stage Bowser Keys  or  Keys  are items used to progress through  key doors  that are obtained by defeating  Bowser  at the end of a  Bowser Stage . There are two keys in  Super Mario 64 , one from  Bowser in the Dark World , which unlocks the  basement , and one from  Bowser in the Fire Sea , which unlocks the  second floor . The only way to skip a key is to do  Moat Door Skip  to go into the basement without ever having to interact with the basement key door. There is no way to skip the upstairs key door since it triggers the loading zone to the second floor, with no different entrances to get in (e.g., moat door). Because of this, Bowser in the Fire Sea is mandatory to finish the game. Behavior When the key spawns, its Y-velocity is set to 70. Sparkles are spawned and the key is set to interact with walls and floors. When the key hits the ground, it plays a sound. When the key hits the ground and has stopped bouncing, the key\u2019s action is incremented by 1. Once this occurs, the key is able to be picked up by Mario. When the key rotates, its facing angle is increased by its angular velocity each frame. If this angular velocity exceeds 5.625 degrees/frame, it is decreased by a value of 1.40625 degrees/frame every frame. Thus, the key rotates quickly when it first spawns and its rotation slows down. Glitches On the Japanese version after collecting a key, a  Star will float around Mario instead of the actual key On the Japanese version if you C-up and look somewhere else before collecting the key,  Mario's head will stay in that direction , giving the appearance of a broken neck.

{"prompt": "Explain Tilted Inverted Pyramid Platform", "completion": "Tilting Inverted Pyramid Platform Technical Constants Object Group Surface Tilted Inverted Pyramid Platforms are a type of platform object appearing in  Lethal Lava Land  and  Bowser in the Fire Sea . The platform basically tilts and moves Mario with it. Behavior The Tilting Inverted Pyramid creates a transformation matrix using its x,y,z coordinates and its x,y,z normal. The pyramid is initialized with x and z-normals of 0, and a y-normal of 1, so that the pyramid will always spawn in with its flat portion facing directly upwards. Once the pyramid is initialized, it behaves by calculating new normals when Mario is standing on it and then tilts and moves Mario with it. When Mario is on the platform, a matrix is formed from the difference between Mario\u2019s x,y,z coordinates and the platforms x,y,z coordinates. This matrix is then multiplied by the transformation matrix to give a new matrix encoding Mario\u2019s position before the platform rotates. The game calculates an approximate distance between Mario\u2019s position and the platform\u2019s position by the usual distance formula \u221a(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2 ), where dx,dz represent the difference between Mario and the platform\u2019s x and z coordinates, and dy is always assumed to be 500. The game then calculates new normal for the pyramid by scaling each factor dx,dy,dz by the approximate distance. Once the new target normals are calculated, the pyramid approaches these values by incrementing the current normal by .01 until they reach a final target normal. Every time the pyramids normals are updated, the platform\u2019s orientation is updated to match. Finally, if Mario is on the pyramid, the game creates a new matrix encoding Mario\u2019s expected new position on the platform and uses the difference between it and the previous position matrix to update Mario\u2019s position.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Bob-omb Battlefield)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way. No Joystick Allowed The 100 coin star is currently used to reset Mario's ascent of steep slopes, which is useful near the top of the pyramid in  Shifting Sand Land  to collect the stars  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  and  Pyramid Puzzle .

{"prompt": "Explain Time stop - Glitch", "completion": "Time stop  (also known as  Timestop ) is a game mechanic present in all versions of SM64. There is a trick exclusive to the  J 1.0  version, which allows  Mario  to move around when objects are frozen due to a text box that is supposed to appear. Contents 1   Intended Behavior 2   Glitch 2.1   Proximity Textboxes 2.2   Holdable Object Textboxes 3   Effects 3.1   Infinite Coins 4   Other Versions of SM64 Intended Behavior The intended behavior of the Time Stop mechanism is to freeze everything except  Mario  and the talking object when Mario is in a textbox. Alternatively, during a star spawning cutscene, all objects are frozen (including Mario) excluding any stars that are spawning. Glitch On the  J 1.0  version of SM64, queueing a textbox immediately stops time for everything besides the talking object and Mario,  regardless if Mario is actually in a state to see the textbox . This can be exploited to move around stages with everything besides Mario and the talking object frozen. There are two ways to activate the Time Stop trick, proximity textboxes and textboxes from holdable objects. Neither way works with all textboxes of either type. Proximity Textboxes \"Proximity Textboxes\" are defined as textboxes that appear when Mario is near an object. If  Mario  jumps right when the textbox is about to activate, then Mario will be able to move in midair until he touches ground again, after which the textbox will start. While Mario is in the air, time will be stopped. Holdable Object Textboxes By picking up an object that normally triggers a text box and then dropping it before it can display the textbox, time stop can be activated. Mario can safely touch the ground and move around at this point without restarting time. The only known example of this type of Time Stop is the lower  Ukiki  in Tall Tall Mountain. Time is not stopped for the object that was used to stop it in either case. Effects Objects (in most cases) stay inanimate, and keep the exact same state they were in when time was stopped. If an object was intangible due to being far from Mario, it will stay intangible even when Mario comes near it until time is started again, because objects do not update in time stop. Infinite Coins If a coin is collected during time stop, the coin counter will increment but the coin object will not unload until the textbox finishes. If the player enters a warp to cancel the textbox, it is possible to repeat the procedure infinitely since the coin is never unloaded. Other Versions of SM64 The developers patched this glitch in all versions of the game besides J 1.0, by making sure that time does not stop until a textbox is in the process of being displayed. Time still stops for textboxes on other versions, but there is no known way to move around during this state. The proximity method for Time Stop is still possible in other versions, but time does not stop and the textbox does not appear until Mario touches the ground. This allows for tricks such as getting a 0.0 time on  Koopa the Quick  in both of their races."}
{"prompt": "Explain 120 Star", "completion": "The goal of the  120 Star  category is to complete the game as fast as possible while collecting all 120 stars.

Beat the game. No gameplay restrictions. (As such, all forms of BLJ and methods of skipping star door requirements are allowed.) Recommendations It is generally recommended to learn  70 Star  before 120; most stars performed in that category are performed the same in 120, allowing you to focus more on the longer, 120-specific stars. Routing There are several routes for 120 Star regarding stage order and castle movement. The biggest distinction is whether the harder  LBLJ  trick is done at the beginning. The route below is the most common route variant of both the LBLJ and non-LBLJ routes; it aims to reach the basement as early as possible since it contains some of the most difficult stars in the run. Bob-omb Battlefield is typically done before the basement (to get to 30 stars to access the basement), but may be swapped with Cool, Cool Mountain, or both back-to-back (if one doesn't mind delaying going to the basement). Once you have learned all of the stars separately, you will be able to adapt to other routes fairly easily. Route This route has an option:  with LBLJ  vs  no LBLJ  (as explained above). The only difference in star order is swapping BoB:  Behind Chain Chomp's Gate  with  Bowser in the Dark World (Reds)  +  Bowser Battle 1 , and then there are the castle movement differences that that entails (including  LBLJ  itself).

The second baby penguin is found near the Mother Penguin in  Cool, Cool Mountain , atop the little hut at the bottom of the level. Bringing this baby penguin to the mother penguin does  not  result in a star. Big Penguins Unlike the baby penguins, there are several more instances of larger penguins. Two of which are in  Cool, Cool Mountain . CCM Penguins The first of the bigger penguins is the Mother Penguin of Tuxie. The Mother Penguin is found at the bottom of CCM, near the 2nd baby penguin, outside the lower hut.     Also in CCM is the 2nd big penguin, found within the slide portion of CCM, in the hut at the top of the mountain. Once you complete the first star of CCM,  Slip Slidin' Away , you can re-enter the slide and race this penguin. Upon beating him in the race, you will be rewarded the  Big Penguin Race  star. SL Penguins The final Big Penguin is in  Snowman's Land , found partway up the snowman. He aids you crossing in front of the snowman's face, blocking the snowman from blowing you back down to the bottom. CCM infinite coins The Mother Penguin may play a possibly important part in the  CCM infinite coins  route. Because the Mother Penguin gives a dialogue,  Time Stop  can be activated on the  J 1.0  version of SM64. It is theorized that this penguin could play an integral role in performing the CCM infinite coins glitch.

It can be accessed from the painting in the rightmost room of the first floor of Princess Peach's castle. The door leading to it requires at least 3 Power Stars to be opened without a  lobby BLJ . 120 Route Plunder in the Sunken Ship Through the Jet Stream Red Coins on the Ship Afloat + 100 Coins Blast to the Stone Pillar Treasure of the Ocean Cave Can the Eel Come out to Play? Star Select Info There are three versions of the course that can appear by selecting different stars. Keep in mind that if there are any blue stars (uncollected) present in the star selection menu, then the last version that can be selected is the first blue star and not the stars after it. Act 1: Sunken Ship : Accessed by selecting Star 1. The ship is sunken under water, and the eel will be hiding in it. Additionally, there will be fog above the water in this version. Act 2: Surfaced Ship : Accessed by selecting Star 2. The ship is floating at the surface of the water, and the eel is relocated at a hole. Bob-omb Buddy is available to talk to, allowing the cannon to be unlocked. Star 2 and 6 are also now collectable. Act 3: Swimming Eel \u00a0: Accessed by selecting Star 3 through Star 6 only after collecting  Can the Eel Come out to Play? . This is version 2, with the exception that the eel will always be swimming around, without a star on its tail.  It should be avoided in RTA as the eel will cause the game to lag. Tips In order to collect  Red Coins on the Ship Afloat + 100 Coins ,  Through the Jet Stream  or  Can the Eel Come out to Play? , you must first collect  Plunder in the Sunken Ship . In order to collect  Blast to the Stone Pillar , you must first open the cannon in  Red Coins on the Ship Afloat + 100 Coins .

{"prompt": "Explain Challenges", "completion": "A  Challenge  is a self-imposed restriction of performing certain tasks, making the completion of the game harder. Restrictions include the use of a certain button (the  A Button , for example), the use of cannons, collecting coins, and the use of caps, among others. Often, these challenges lead to the discovery of glitches, while some must be utilized to make up for a loss of a certain function. For example, restricting the A button forces Mario to use techniques such as frame-walking, enemy manipulation, and  cloning  to complete certain tasks. Collecting the 5 secrets in Bob-omb Battlefield coinless requires making a  Premature Clone  of the top coin and landing at the 30-unit high area to collect the secret without interacting with the center coin. Contents 1   UBER Challenge 2   Pacifist Challenge 3   A Button Challenge 4   Coinless Challenge 5   Cannonless Challenge 6   Capless/Cannonless Challenge 7   CCC Challenge 8   No Buttons Allowed/Buttonless Challenge 9   ABZ Challenge 10   Low Doors Challenge 11   No Joystick Allowed Challenge 12   Floor is Lava Challenge 13   Joke Challenges 14   Other challenges 15   References UBER Challenge Main article:  UBER Challenge The UBER Challenge forbids any coins and  collectibles  (except chests), switches, cannons, teleporting, caps, opening boxes (except for star boxes), damage (except falling), and activating movable platforms. Additionally, enemies must not be interacted with (including Lakitu, but excluding Bowser and MIPS). The challenge was created by Mario64Masters. The name of the UBER Challenge was borrowed from Manocheese's \u00dcber Challenge for Ocarina of Time. There are 39 stars that can be collected RTA, and 46 stars are possible in a TAS run. Pacifist Challenge Main article:  Pacifist Challenge The Pacifist Challenge forbids any combat with enemies except for Bowser. Any actions that do not result in killing an enemy are allowed. The number of stars that can be collected is 98 glitchless, and 101 for TAS runs [1] . In a full game run, however, killing the Boo to enter  Big Boo's Haunt  is considered nonpacifist, cutting off the available 2 stars, and therefore the actual number of stars that can be collected is 96 glitchless and 99 with TAS. The following stars cannot be collected in the RTA pacifist run. BoB  (2):  Big Bob-omb on the Summit  (enemy),  Footrace with Koopa The Quick  (requires the previous star) WF  (2):  Chip Off Whomp's Block  (enemy),  To the Top of the Fortress  (requires the previous star) BBH  (7): All stars are cut off due to entering the course requiring killing a Boo. If entering the stage is allowed, then only two stars ( Secret of the Haunted Books  and  Seek the 8 Red Coins ) can be collected. HMC  (1):  HMC 100 coins  (only 92 non-enemy coins) LLL  (2):  Boil the Big Bully  (enemy),  Bully the Bullies  (enemy) SSL  (1):  Stand Tall on the Four Pillars  (enemy) SL  (1):  Chill with the Bully  (enemy), THI  (4):  Pluck the Piranha Flower  (enemy),  Rematch with Koopa the Quick  (requiring Star 1),  Make Wiggler Squirm (enemy) ,  THI 100 coins  (infinite coin glitch requires killing Piranhas) The following stars can be circumvented if glitches or TAS strategies are allowed: WF  -  Blast Away the Wall : A wall clip can be performed to reach the star cannonless. SSL  -  SSL 100 coins : 100 coins can be collected using infinite coin glitch, done by disappearing cork box glitch in the course. 86 non-enemy coins otherwise. SL  -  SL 100 coins : 100 coins can be collected with an infinite coin glitch, by activating  Time Stop  from the snowman and repeatedly collecting a nearby coin. 58 non-enemy coins otherwise. A Button Challenge Main article:  A Button Challenge The A Button Challenge aims to reduce the use of  A Button  in courses, first documented in  Curtis Bright's website . Since then, many techniques are applied in an attempt to bring down the A Press count, with  pannenkoek2012  being the biggest contributor to the challenge. There are 98 stars that can be collected on a full game basis without the A Button using TAS. A 120-star run of the game can be completed in 13. Coinless Challenge The Coinless Challenge's only rule is that the player cannot collect any coins. Specifically, no yellow, red, or blue coins can be collected. Techniques where Mario's coin score is saved as 0 coins by collecting multiples of 256, or pause buffering to prevent the coin counter from going up, are not allowed. Mario is able to collect 81 stars in a full game run, and 82 stars on a single star basis. The remaining 38 stars require collecting coins and are therefore impossible. Cannonless Challenge In the Cannonless Challenge, entering any cannons is forbidden. As it turns out, all 120 stars can be collected cannonless. The challenge was completed on 23 July 2018 by sm64expert, when he collected the  Wing Mario Over the Rainbow Red Coin Star . [2] Capless/Cannonless Challenge To qualify as capless, Mario cannot use any special caps except the cap effects obtained from the start of a course. To qualify as cannonless, Mario cannot use any cannons. Using the capless and cannonless ruleset from the UBER Challenge, every star except for one ( Wing Mario Over the Rainbow Red Coin Star ) can be collected, resulting 119 stars that can be collected. The most difficult stars to collect include: BoB  -  Shoot to the Island in the Sky ,  100 Coins ,  Find the 8 Red Coins : Going to the island can be done by long jumping from the top of the mountain. SSL  -  Free Flying for 8 Red Coins : Tornadoes, Fly Guys, and Klepto can help Mario collect the 4 aerial coins without the wing cap. Vanish Cap under the Moat : The cage can be reached by performing a side flip to a wall kick, removing the need of using a vanish cap. CCC Challenge Main article:  CCC Challenge The CCC Challenge combines Coinless with Capless/Cannonless. The restriction is extremely heavy, leaving very few stars that can be collected, as some of them inadvertently collect coins during the process. Mario is able to collect 81 stars in a full game run, and 82 stars on a single star basis. While this is the same number of stars collectible as Coinless Challenge, the workarounds are much harder to achieve. No Buttons Allowed/Buttonless Challenge Main article:  No Buttons Allowed Challenge The No Buttons Allowed Challenge forbids the use of A, B, Z, Start, L, R, and (to some extent) C buttons. This challenge was created by pannenkoek2012 to push the game to its limits. The C buttons are only allowed when they only affect the camera and don't affect actual gameplay. For example, the  C^ Hyperspeed  glitch is not allowed. The challenge is more difficult than simply restricting the A button, since this disables many maneuvering options that Mario can use, such as jumping, diving, sliding, and more. The challenge cannot be done as a full game run as there is in-game text that cannot be advanced without the use of buttons. There are only 34 stars that can be collected, many of which require complicated strategies. [3] ABZ Challenge Main article:  ABZ Button Challenge The ABZ Challenge is similar to Buttonless, but instead of restricting all buttons only restricts the three primary buttons, A B and Z. Instead of requiring that they don't be used at all, it allows simply using the minimum number of buttons possible. It was as an alternative to the Buttonless Challenge, since the Buttonless Challenge did not allow the start button, and consequently did not allow changing languages on PAL version to minimize text box button presses. Low Doors Challenge In the Low Doors Challenge, the game must be beaten while opening as few doors as possible. A door is considered used when the door opening cutscene occurs. Doors are skipped using BLJs and HSWKs, pause exiting, and routing to avoid moving between castle floors unnecessarily. Any% needs to open only 2 doors to complete: one door to enter the basement (using either the key door or moat door), and one door to enter the upper floors. 120 Stars needs to open 4 doors to complete: one to enter the basement (using either the key door or moat door), one to enter the upper floors, one to enter the courtyard for BBH, and one to exit the CCM slide level through the cabin. Unconfirmed door skips exist in BBH, HMC, and skipping the door to the endless stairs using HSWKs. The 50 star door stairs BLJ cannot be used for the latter, as Mario needs to stop at the 3rd floor to get all stars, and cannot pause exit out from the 3rd floor. No Joystick Allowed Challenge Main article:  No Joystick Allowed Challenge The No Joystick Allowed Challenge forbids the use of Joystick inputs, considered to be the inverse of No Buttons Allowed Challenge. As the joystick provides the vital function for Mario to change directions and run, the challenge takes route planning to the extreme. The challenge can only be done on a single star basis and not a full game run due to absurd limitations. There are only 55 stars that can be collected, many of which require complicated strategies. A related challenge is the  Low Joystick Magnitude Challenge , in which the joystick is allowed but the magnitude of the joystick is to be minimized. The value to be minimized can be either the largest joystick magnitude needed in a run or segment, or the total magnitude value integrated over the whole run. Floor is Lava Challenge The  Floor is Lava Challenge  disallows standing on floors that aren't part of objects. It was created by Timestoppa. Joke Challenges Some challenges have been created as jokes, and then actually been executed, such as Plush% (collecting specific stars to make the  STROOP  file menu spell out \"PLUSH\"). Another joke challenge: \"prove for as many actions as possible that they can transition into  Eaten By Bubba  in vanilla\". [4] Other challenges The  Same Input Challenge  is a challenge where the goal is to collect as many stars as possible using the same sequence of inputs. Many other smaller challenges exist, with the goal not always being to collect a star. See  Unsolved Single-Goal Challenges  for single-goal challenges that have not been solved.

They appear in many courses. They can be defeated by landing on them, punching or kicking them, or interacting with other objects. Contents 1   Varieties 2   Spawning 3   Locations 4   Use in Challenges 5   Trivia 6   References Varieties There are three varieties of Goombas. Regular Goombas, huge Goombas, and tiny Goombas. The latter two appear in Tiny-Huge Island while the former is used everywhere else. The Goomba has 5 properties that vary based on the Goomba\u2019s variety: scale, death sound, draw distance, damage and gravity value. These differences are outlined in the attached table. In addition, the huge Goombas have different attack handlers. Punches, kicks, fast attacks and attacks from below will kill regular and tiny Goombas but not huge Goombas, and ground pounding a huge Goomba will make it drop a blue coin.

Singleton Goombas that remain loaded from the start of the level, and Goomba trios that load and unload using a  Goomba Spawner . Goombas from Goomba trios are the only ones that can be  cloned  without a  loading zone . Locations The following courses have Goombas: Bob-omb Battlefield Jolly Roger Bay Bowser in the Dark World Shifting Sand Land Bowser in the Fire Sea Snowman's Land Tall, Tall Mountain Tiny-Huge Island Rainbow Ride Bowser in the Sky Use in Challenges Bouncing on Goombas provides a height advantage, which is useful in challenges, especially the  A Button Challenge , where bouncing on Goombas can be used as an alternative to jumping. Cloned Goombas can be placed in specific spots to allow bounces in specific spots where Goombas can not usually go (such as in midair). Large numbers of Goomba clones are used to create  Goomba structures , allowing Mario to perform multiple consecutive bounces to go forwards or upwards in midair. Trivia Mario can squish Goombas while flying, if he is flying slowly and downwards.

{"prompt": "Explain Mupen64 - Mupen64plus", "completion": "Mupen64  is a  Nintendo 64   emulator  useful for its TASing capabilities.  There are many forks of Mupen64, the primary community-maintained one being  mupen64-rr-lua , which is nearly universally used for TASing Super Mario 64 Contents 1   Mupen64plus 2   mupen64-rr-lua 2.1   Recording movies 2.2   Continuing Movies 2.3   Features 2.3.1   Lua 2.3.2   Show Ram Start 2.3.3   Emulate Float Crashes 2.3.4   Clock Speed Control 2.3.5   WiiVC Rounding 3   References Mupen64plus Mupen64plus  (stylized as  mupen64plus ) is an emulator used for real-time gameplay.  It is generally preferred in this regard over Mupen64. Mupen64plus, as well as m64p-based frontends such as OpenEMU, are also allowed for Super Mario 64  speedrunning . mupen64-rr-lua mupen64-rr-lua  is an emulator used for TASing and is most commonly used to record and play back TAS movies.  It is a fork of Mupen64-RR-lua which is actively maintained by the community. It introduces the lua scripting extension, QoL features, and security patches Recording movies Navigate to the `Movie` menu and select `Start Movie Recording`...

It is used for TASing, as well as for testing and preparing. Show Ram Start copies the Ram Start address to the clipboard to configure an external RAM-watch like  STROOP . Emulate Float Crashes mupen64-rr-lua supports crashing during certain float-to-short exceptions just like the  Nintendo 64  console does. This is a useful alternative to  console verification , but not as reliable, because there are still some  unknown crashes . Clock Speed Control mupen64-rr-lua supports changing the emulated CPU's clock speed with a multiplier, allowing lagless emulation. WiiVC Rounding mupen64-rr-lua supports emulating the  Wii VC Round-To-Zero  oversight [2] . It has been used, among other things, by pannenkoek2012 to TAS the  Bowser in the Fire Sea 0x A presses  run [3] .

{"prompt": "Explain Terrain", "completion": "Terrain  is a course variable that changes how different things in the level behave. There are 8 total different terrain types, although only 7 are actually used in-game. Behavior Terrain controls mainly how different surfaces behave within the level. Mostly, it impacts the noises different floors will make in-game (and many unused floor/terrain combos have unique sounds set). Floors that let you get stuck in them, like  SSL  and  CCM , are also determined by terrain type. Additionally, slide levels have their own terrain types that overrides the slipperiness of floors to be that of a slide. Snowy water, such as in CCM or  SL , also drains Mario's HP whilst being swum in.

Skeeters move around on the water, damaging Mario should he run into them. Behavior If Skeeter is on the ground, Skeeter idles for a random amount of time and then begins walking around. Skeeter walks around in random directions in a radius of 1000 units around its home with a top speed of 10 units per frame. If Mario is within 500 units of Skeeter, Skeeter's top speed increases to 20 units per frame and it turns toward Mario while walking forward. If Skeeter is on water, then after 60 frames Skeeter will enter its lunging action. In its lunging action, skeeter moves forward at 80 units per frame, decelerating to 0 units per frame at a rate of .8 units per frame per frame. If Skeeter collides with a wall, Skeeter's speed decreases by 70% every frame. When Skeeter's speed hits 0 and its current animation ends, Skeeter randomly chooses a new target angle and then idles for a random amount of time between 0 and 30 frames. When Skeeter is killed its death sound plays and 3 coins spawn.

{"prompt": "Explain Water", "completion": "Water  is a phenomenon in  Super Mario 64 . Its main property is the water level, which determines its location in the level. Water consists of a plane that extends to the edges of the main map and infinitely far downwards. Contents 1   Effect on Mario 1.1   Surface Upwarp 1.2   Swimming 1.3   Surface Jumping 2   Effect on Other Objects 3   References Effect on Mario When Mario enters water in any way, he enters the  action  called  water plunge . After 19  frames , he enters  water action end . Then, he enters the  in water  idle action. Most water-based actions are in the  Submerged   action group  and have the  Swimming   action flag  set. Surface Upwarp Main article:  Water Surface Upwarp Whenever Mario enters water, he instantly upwarps to its surface. However, this can be cancelled if the water's surface is within a  ceiling  hitbox, as the game normally does not let Mario enter ceiling hitboxes. Swimming When Mario presses the A button, he enters  swim (1/2) . He moves forward and then enters  swim (2/2) . Finally, he enters  water action end  and then back to  in water . If Mario holds the A button, he enters the  flutterkick  action. If Mario instead presses the B button, he enters the  water grab  action followed by  water action end . Surface Jumping Please add the specific requirements for this  If Mario holds down on the joystick while at the water's surface and presses A, he will enter  water jump  and then  water plunge  if he reenters the water. Effect on Other Objects This article is a  stub . As such, it is not complete. You can help Ukikipedia by  expanding it . Goombas will die once they touch water.

{"prompt": "Explain Framewalk", "completion": "  Demonstration of frame walking Frame Walking  is a glitch that allows Mario to walk up steep slopes that would normally cause him to slip and slide. [1] It is done by alternating between no input on the joystick and using the joystick to walk up the slope. The optimal method is 1 frame no input, and 1 frame walking up the slope. However it is not frame perfect, and multiple frames can be taken with each of them although this is slower. Frame walking works by taking advantage of the fact that Mario will not start sliding on a steep slope until his speed reaches 0. However, when Mario decelerates and then begins walking again, if his speed is less than 8 it is set to 8. Because of this, Mario never begins sliding and can walk up the slope. Frame walking does not work on slippery slopes, which cause Mario to slide down even if frame walking is attempted. Frame walking is primarily used in challenges such the  A Button Challenge . The glitch allows Mario to reach areas otherwise inaccessible without jumping.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves.

Plunder in the Sunken Ship When you select star 1, Unagi will be in the sunken ship at the bottom of the level, blocking the entrance to the interior of the ship. To lure him out,  Mario  must swim back up to the surface, then he may swim back down to enter the ship. If Mario does not go into the ship, Unagi will go back into the ship and Mario must lure him back out again in order to get access to the area again. Can the Eel Come out to Play? When you select stars 2-6, Unagi will be hiding in a hole on the side of the main pit of the course. For him to leave, Mario simply needs to get near Unagi. It will have the star on its tail and Mario will need to touch that star to spawn it and make it collectable. Likewise to the first star, Unagi will eventually swim back into the hole after a while."}

{"prompt": "Explain Nonstop", "completion": "Nonstop is a category extension that uses special codes/patches to prevent the player from being kicked out of the level after collecting a non-100-coin star. This means that you can just grab a star and keep going for the next one, with the exception of needing to reload stages for star-requirement triggers, like beating King Bob-omb in order to race Koopa the Quick. This significantly changes routing options in many stages. Because of this behavior with stars, only cap switches have the ability to save anymore, and collecting coins doesn't give extra lives, which is important because many stage exits rely on dying to not exit course back to the lobby. You can find codes/patches on the  SRC CE resources page . Nonstop has 3 sub-categories: 16 Star 70 Star 120 Star"}

{"prompt": "Explain Crazy Box", "completion": "Crazy Box Hitbox Info Hitbox cylinder with radius of 150 and height of 250, offset down 20 units Interaction type Grabbable Related Cork Box Found In Big Boo's Haunt ,  Tall, Tall Mountain ,  Lethal Lava Land ,  Shifting Sand Land Crazy Boxes , also called  Crazed Crates , are small grabbable boxes which, when grabbed, cause Mario to bounce three times in the direction he was facing, before exploding into five  coins . Once Mario has grabbed a Crazy Box, he can change the speed of the bounces with the joystick, but the angle will remain the same. Contents 1   Water 2   Cloning 2.1   Via HOLP manipulation 2.2   Via Water 2.3   Via Slope 3   References Water If Mario enters  water  while bouncing with a Crazy Box, the bouncing animation will end and he will enter a swimming state as if he was holding a  Cork Box . When he gets back on land the bouncing animation will start over with whatever angle he left the water with. [1] Cloning Main article:  Cloning It is normally impossible to grab a crazy box as it explodes, since normally the player is not in control of Mario when a crazy box is dropped at the end of its bouncing. However, there are some workarounds. Via HOLP manipulation It is possible to use  HOLP  manipulation to transport a crazy box far enough away that it deactivates. This gives Mario time to prepare for catching it. Via Water If a crazy box is carried into water, then it is possible to jump out of the water and throw it. With proper positioning, Mario can throw it and then grab it as it explodes. Via Slope If a crazy box is dropped along a slope (e.g. by standing still while holding it handsfree), then Mario can turn and grab the box before it reaches the ground.

{"prompt": "Explain RNG", "completion": "RNG  or  Random Number Generator  is the game's  pseudorandom number generator . It allows the game can make things like dust movement seem random [1] . Contents 1   Technical description 1.1   The RNG function 1.2   Description 1.3   Impossible RNG 2   Cycling RNG 3   Objects that call RNG 3.1   Tick Tock Clock Random Setting Only 4   References Technical description The RNG consists of two parts: the evolution function (also known as the RNG function), and the seed. Whenever something (usually an  object ) wants to use the RNG, it calls the evolution function. The evolution function will read the seed, perform a series of mathematical operations on it, and return the new value of the seed. This means that the seed always reflects the last value that the RNG function returned. Because each object can load, unload, and use RNG multiple times per frame, the RNG function is often called an unpredictable number of times every frame. This makes the game's randomness often unpredictable even if you know the RNG function. The RNG function Here is pseudocode of the RNG function. Note that it relies heavily on bitwise/binary operations, specifically the XOR operation. set RNGSeed to 0 function RNG:     if RNGSeed is 22026:         set RNGSeed to 0     set value A to (the last byte of RNGSeed) shifted to the left by 1 byte     set value A to (value A) XOR (RNGSeed)          set RNGSeed to value A     swap the bytes of RNGSeed          set value A to (the last byte of value A) shifted to the left by 1 bit     set value A to (value A) XOR (RNGSeed)     set value B to (value A) shifted to the right by 1 bit     set value B to (value B) XOR 1111111110000000 (binary)          if the last bit of value A is 0:         if value B is 43605:             set RNGSeed to 0         else:             set RNGSeed to (value B) XOR 0001111111110100 (binary)     else:         set RNGSeed to (value B) XOR 1000000110000000 (binary)          return RNGSeed Here is a walkthrough. We begin with the seed set to, say, 64917. This is 1111110110010101 in binary. First, this seed is not equal to 22026, so we don't set it to 0. Each byte is 8 bits (1s or 0s), so the first byte of the seed is 11111101 and the last byte is 10010101. We set value A to the last byte 1001010, shifted to the left 1 byte. This means 1 byte of 0s are added onto the end. Value A now has the value 1001010100000000 in binary. Now we XOR value A with the seed. XOR, or Exclusive Or, is a bitwise operation that acts on each bit in the numbers. It takes the corresponding pairs of bits in each number, and checks if they are the same or not. If they are the same, a 0 is put into a new number at the location the pair of bits both had in their original numbers; if they are not the same, a 1 is put.     11111101 10010101 - seed XOR 10010101 00000000 - value A ---------------------     01101000 10010101 - new number            ^        ^ 1 and 0 are different, so the new number has a 1 in this place.            1 and 1 are the same, so the new number has a 0 in this place. Value A is set to this new number. Then the bytes of value A are swapped and the seed is set to that, so the seed becomes 1001010101101000. The current state is: - Seed: 1001010101101000 - Value A: 0110100010010101 The last byte of value A is 10010101, and shifting this to the left by 1 bit gives 100101010. Value A is set to that, so it becomes 0000000100101010. It's XORed with the seed again, and value A is set to the new value:     10010101 01101000 - seed XOR 00000001 00101010 - value A ---------------------     10010100 01000010 - new value A Now we declare value B, and set it to value A but shifted to the right one bit. Value A is 1001010001000010, so value B becomes 0100101000100001. Value B is now XORed with the number 1111111110000000, which is a so-called \"magic number\": its purpose is not clear in the code.     01001010 00100001 - value B XOR 11111111 10000000 - magic number ---------------------     10110101 10100001 - new value B The current state is: - Seed: 1001010101101000 - Value A: 1001010001000010 - Value B: 1011010110100001 The last bit of value A is 0, so we look at value B. In decimal, it is 46497, not 43605, so the seed will be set to value B XOR 0001111111110100. This is another magic number.     10110101 10100001 - value B XOR 00011111 11110100 - magic number ---------------------     10101010 01010101 - new seed Now we return the seed. 1010101001010101 in decimal is 43605, which is the expected result. Description The function has 65536 possible inputs and 65536 possible outputs. It is a bijection, meaning that every input maps to exactly one output and none repeat or are left out. The function forms two loops, one of length 65534 and one of length 2, but one of the if statements causes the cycle of 2 to lead back to the cycle of 65534. Oddly, the RNG value of 21674 at index 65113 loops back to index 0. This may be because this index's S1 value is equal to the previous RNG value for the first time, but that is no reason to prematurely end the loop. The RNG index and value of 0 is set when the game powers on. Impossible RNG Impossible RNG values are values that are theoretically legal within the game, but cannot be reached due to how the RNG values cycle. 1 set of these is a 2 value RNG loop (values 22026 and 58704) that has no lead-in's from the main loop. If you entered this loop somehow, it would send you back to the main loop almost immediately. The other set (indices 65114-65533) is caused by there being a manual check that resets the primary loop early. This leaves the latter part of the loop, after the reset, unreachable. Any other RNG is considered possible. Cycling RNG Because RNG indices loop from 0 to 65113 and back to 0 again, by looping through every RNG index Mario can reach any reachable RNG value. By making  dust , Mario can advance RNG 4 times per frame, which takes 9 minutes to loop. If objects are calling RNG, this time will be much faster. Objects that call RNG The following objects always call RNG under the given circumstances. Dust calls RNG to determine its resultant  angle  and  horizontal speed . Note that the dust itself calls RNG, not the  dust spawner . Goombas  call RNG to determine which direction to move when they do not see Mario. Bob-ombs  call RNG almost every frame to determine whether to  blink . If the value that they receive is less than 656, they blink. Otherwise, they don't. Taking into account impossible RNG, the chance of a Bob-omb blinking on a given frame is 0.0099785. Although not an object,  snow  also calls RNG. Coins  from Bob-ombs, Goombas,  Big Cork Boxes ,  Cork Boxes ,  Piranha Plants ,  Bullies ,  Chuckyas ,  Fly Guys ,  Snowmen , etc... you name it, it calls RNG 3 times to determine angle, horizontal speed, and  vertical speed . Since angles are shorts just like RNG, the RNG value is used directly for the angle. Horizontal speed is set to (RNG / 65536) * 20, and vertical speed is set to (RNG / 65536) * 40 + 17. Since these RNG calls must be contiguous, there are still only 65114 possible coin trajectories. Bowser  calls RNG to determine which attack to do next. And many, many, many more. Tick Tock Clock  Random Setting Only The following objects call RNG under the given circumstances when the clock was entered at 6 (the random setting). Click on the link for more details. Spinners Cogs  call RNG twice when they reach their target  angular velocity  (TAV) [2] . The cog approaches its TAV with an angular acceleration of \u00b150AU/frame\u00b2. The first call determines the cog's next TAV. Because of the way the formula is structured, there is a possibility that the TAV is 0. If this occurs multiple times, the cog can stand still. The TAV is calculated by the following formula: Target Angular Velocity = (RNG\u00a0% 7) * 200 The second RNG call determines the sign of the TAV. If the result is less than 32768, the sign is -1, and 1 otherwise. The following table summarizes this information: RNG1\u00a0% 7 0 (14.313358%) 1 (14.265749%) 2 (14.278035%) 3 (14.281107%) 4 (14.282643%) 5 (14.284179%) 6 (14.284929%) RNG2 < 32768 (50.016893%) 0 (7.1551433%) -200 (7.1274995%) -400 (7.1413214%) -600 (7.1490002%) -800 (7.1443929%) -1000 (7.1505360%) -1200 (7.1490002%) RNG2 \u2265 32768 (49.983107%) 0 (7.1582148%) 200 (7.1382498%) 400 (7.1367141%) 600 (7.1321068%) 800 (7.1382498%) 1000 (7.1336425%) 1200 (7.1459287%) References \u2191   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiuLeTE2MeQ \u2191   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0q3_toE3b4"}

{"prompt": "Explain Backwards Long Jump - Elevator BLJ", "completion": "The  Backwards  Long Jump  hyperspeed method, or  BLJ  for short, is the most famous  hyperspeed  method in Super Mario 64. Due to their versatility, BLJs are commonly used in all kinds of  speedruns  and  challenges . When Mario initiates a long jump, his horizontal speed is multiplied by 3/2. A BLJ occurs when a backwards long jump is interrupted before the effects of drag can counteract the speed gain from the 3/2 multiplier. This does not occur with forwards long jumps because long jumps have a \"hard cap\" of +48 horizontal speed which Mario's speed cannot exceed. No such cap exists in the negative direction because normally the \"soft cap\" of -16 speed from drag is easily enough to stop any speed gain. There are several different types of BLJs. The distinguishing feature of different types of BLJs is what they use to interrupt the long jump: Slope BLJs use slopes by going up the slope. Stair BLJs use stairs by going up the stairs. Elevator BLJs use the upwards movement of an elevator or other object. Side BLJs  use two floors at slightly different levels by oscillating between them. Ceiling BLJs use an exposed ceiling or low-hanging ceiling by making Mario hit his head and start travelling downwards faster. BLJs can also be  pause buffered  to increase the amount of long jumps that can be performed in a given amount of time or space. The BLJ glitch was patched in the  Shindou release , and therefore also the  iQue version . This also means that any emulator releases of these game versions lack the BLJ glitch, namely the  Japanese Wii VC release , the  Japanese Wii U VC release , and all versions of  Super Mario 3D All-Stars . Contents 1   Slope BLJ 2   Stair BLJ 3   Elevator BLJ 4   Side BLJ 5   Ceiling BLJ Slope BLJ A slope BLJ is performed by interrupting a backwards long jump using a rising slope. Because Mario usually lands immediately after long jumping (assuming a steep enough slope), slope BLJs are normally pause bufferable. Stair BLJ A stair BLJ is similar to a slope BLJ, except using stairs instead of slopes to achieve the rising floor effect. Stair BLJs often cannot be performed when there are wall hitboxes sticking out from the stairs because the walls prevent Mario from landing on the higher floor. Similarly to slope BLJs, stair BLJs are often pause bufferable. Stair BLJs are often used for bypassing doors in the castle. Elevator BLJ Elevator BLJs are also conceptually similar to slope BLJs and stair BLJs in that they too use the floor under Mario rising to interrupt Mario's long jump. Elevator BLJs use elevators as the rising floor. Elevator BLJs are a common solution for when one wishes to quickly get a lot of speed since while slope BLJs and stair BLJs can only last until the slope or stair runs out or Mario hits out-of-bounds, elevator BLJs can last as long as the elevator is moving and don't need to stop when Mario hits out-of-bounds. Because of this, elevator BLJs are the only type of BLJ that can reach  PU  speed. Side BLJ Side BLJs or SBLJs are the most complex type of BLJ. A side BLJ is performed by oscillating between two floors at slightly different heights to achieve an effect similar to a stair BLJ but without needing a long, wall-less staircase. Side BLJs are performed by first having Mario face slightly to the higher floor (so that when Mario's moving backwards, he moves down to the lower floor), then straining to the higher floor during the long jump so that Mario snaps up to it. After long jumping from the lower floor, Mario ends up on the higher floor due to the straining, but because of the direction Mario is facing he snaps down to the lower floor on the next frame. This can then be repeated. Because side BLJs require 1 extra frame per long jump for Mario to snap back down to the lower floor, they cannot be pause buffered. Ceiling BLJ A ceiling BLJ is performed by having Mario hit a ceiling during his long jumps so that Mario starts moving downwards earlier, meaning there's less time for drag to slow Mario down. Ceiling BLJs can be performed with low ceilings or with  exposed ceilings .  Lobby Backwards Long Jump  is an example of this type of BLJ. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp"}
{"prompt": "Explain Hyperspeed Wall Kicks", "completion": "Hyper Speed Wall Kicking  or  HSWK  is a glitch that allows  Mario  to build up speed by repeatedly wall-kicking. Execution By wall-kicking against a wall on the first frame possible, you will conserve your speed. This is known as a \"firsty\". By holding a direction on the joystick when Mario is in the air, he will gain speed. Then you can firsty against another wall and repeat the process. This method usually produces up to 400 speed; after Mario surpasses 400 speed, his intended position will go past the wall. He will therefore either clip through the wall or bonk on out-of-bounds and lose all his speed.

It consists of collecting eight coins scattered around the course and on the ship. Contents 1   Locations 2   TAS 2.1   TAS Strategy 2.2   TAS History 3   A Button Challenge 4   References Locations The red coins are found as followed 4 in the clam shells 1 on top of the pillar next to the bob-omb 3 on the floating ship TAS TAS Strategy Mario begins by going towards the  metal cap  box. He long jumps which allows him to open the box and rebound off the wall with a wall kick dive. He goes to a rock and performs a   BLJ  to gain speed. Mario stops at the wall, since his speed is not enough to pass through out of bounds. He then quickly rotates to the right allowing him to slide along the wall. When he breaks off of the wall, he enters the water so that the first frame inside is as far as possible, which allows maximum distance covered before the water truncates the speed. Mario maneuvers onto a slope which allows for him to move walk quickly as opposed to slowly falling. At the bottom he collects the 1st  red coin . He then move back up the slope, utilizing his speed to clip through the corner of a pillar to get to the next coin. He then turns to move to the 3rd red coin and then does a sharp turn back to reach the 4th. He then turns sharply again, while using a wall for support. He does a kick to move past the wooden board and hits the wall at the end, stopping his movement. Mario quickly  sideflips  onto the platform with the bob-omb and upon landing, does a triple jump and mid-air ground pound to reach the coin on the pillar. He grabs on and readjusts his angle, diving off and landing on the edge of the board which allows him to  grind  and perform a jump dive onto the platform opposite the bob-omb one. He then dives onto the edge of the switch, and uses the slope to cancel his dive recover allowing him to perform another jump dive instantaneously. Mario  long jumps  onto the ship, collecting the bottom red coin. He then dives and uses the dive recover to get onto the edge of the ship, which he then uses to grind and jump dive. He lands just on the edge of the upper ship, and as he lands, holds left so that he can quickly sideflip, and get the 7th coin. He then lands and sideflips in the opposite direction, collecting the coin and activating the star. Mario collects the star on the same sideflip used to collect the last coin.

Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Pole Glitch Pole Glitch is a very precise trick where it is important to do dustless movement. You want to maintain Mario's speed the best you can starting from this image.     Do not get any dust frames on the first rollout, or the trick gets harder.   Jumpdiving between these 2 red lines works best. This part is lenient. If you jumpdive early you will probably bonk on the bottom of the pole. Once again, try to be dustless on the following rollout.   You will land here after the rollout, and the single jump will need to be on the 1st frame after you land. This allows you to get as much height as possible. Hold A until you see Mario has warped. If you release too early, you will bonk. Tutorial Load video YouTube YouTube might collect personal data.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Cool, Cool Mountain)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way. No Joystick Allowed The 100 coin star is currently used to reset Mario's ascent of steep slopes, which is useful near the top of the pyramid in  Shifting Sand Land  to collect the stars  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  and  Pyramid Puzzle .

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Wet-Dry World)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way. No Joystick Allowed The 100 coin star is currently used to reset Mario's ascent of steep slopes, which is useful near the top of the pyramid in  Shifting Sand Land  to collect the stars  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  and  Pyramid Puzzle .

{"prompt": "Explain Bully battery", "completion": "Demonstration of slow bully battery in LLL Bully Battery  is a glitch that uses speed from knocking an out of bounds  bully  repeatedly to allow Mario to gain hyperspeed. If a  bully  is out of bounds, Mario runs into the  bully  repeatedly in order to very slowly cause the  bully  to gain speed with each hit. After, we can transfer the built speed back to Mario to move at hyperspeed. However, Mario needs to either use water or a  squish cancel  to escape the knockback state. Otherwise, the built up speed is immediately lost. The glitch is used to access to beat the star  Elevator Tour in the Volcano  in 0xA-presses and is currently being used as part of a theory for a method to beat  Bowser in the Fire Sea  in 0xA-presses on N64. Fast Bully Battery When Mario gets hit by the bully, the bully speed is transferred to Mario after being multiplied by a conversion ratio of 3*73/53. (73 corresponds to the bully radius and 53 corresponds to Mario's hitbox radius). This would put Mario in the knockback state and cap his speed, but with  Squish Cancel , Mario can switch to the  Squished  state then switch into another state, bypassing the cap and keeping his speed. If Mario now gives this speed back to the bully, it is multiplied by a conversion ratio of 53/73. Overall, this corresponds to the bully's speed being multiplied by 3. Thus, the Bully's speed increases exponentially, with a speed increase on the order of  3 n {\\displaystyle 3^{n}} . Slow Bully Battery When the bully already has speed, Mario can give it even more speed by hitting the bully perpendicular to its velocity vector, giving the bully a new speed according to v B u l l y = [ v B u l l y ] 2 + [ v M a r i o ] 2 {\\displaystyle v_{Bully}={\\sqrt {[v_{Bully}]^{2}+[v_{Mario}]^{2}}}} Assuming Mario's speed is constant every hit, the bully's speed will equal  [ v M a r i o ] n {\\displaystyle [v_{Mario}]{\\sqrt {n}}}  by the  n th hit. The speed is gained very slowly, making it potentially take upwards of months for useful speed to be obtained but it is much less restrictive than the other method.

The combination of stop+punch-trick+long jump allows Mario to reduce his speed so that he can strain back far enough, which is faster than a quickturn long-jump combo. Speed is gained via BLJing in the low ceiling spot under the rock, starting with -15.99 speed. This area used is quite precise with the BLJ being done at an angle which keeps Mario stuck for as long as possible (to get more speed). Mario breaks out of the ceiling when he reaches -826 speed. From there, the BLJ becomes a slope-BLJ, and so pause-buffering allows for more speed gain, up to a final speed of -1855.  After the BLJ, Mario turns around (clockwise) to move towards the water. By making Mario face into the wall slightly, he can still move but doesn't move quite as far. This is just enough to allow Mario to stay out of the water for an additional frame, while only losing a small amount of distance. Since entering the water divides Mario's speed by 4 (with the metal cap), this means he has 1 more frame at full speed. This ultimately saves 2 frames (the theoretical max is just under 3 frames here). Mario then enters the water, losing 3/4 of his speed, but he can now turn around in the water. He turns towards the area above the hole that leads to the chest star. When Mario reaches the edge of the water, he enters the ceiling hitbox above the top of the hole, causing him to downwarp into the cave. He then exits the water and turns as sharply as possible anticlockwise to enter the cave. Inside the cave, Mario clips through a wall, cutting a corner and saving time. He then clips under the raised platform with the chests. He eventually reaches the wall behind the chests, pushing on it for 1 frame which kills his speed. To start moving back towards the chests, Mario kicks against the wall, giving him negative speed. During the kick Mario passes the first chest, activating it. He then turns to face the second chest and jumps. During the dust-frames he (barely) reaches the chest, activating it. He then turns towards the third chest and jumps before dive/recovering. He will have to turn back the other way to face the correct angle to activate the chest later, so the angle chosen must balance allowing Mario to turn for as few frames as possible while still allowing him to actually reach the chest (without losing too much speed through straining). Davo saved a frame here by using a better angle than the previous run. Mario then turns left to reach the required angle to activate the chest, using the chest's hitbox to hold him in place, before turning right again to head for the next chest. Once he reaches the required angle to activate the chest, he dives into it, activating it immediately. Davo saved a frame here by diving earlier than the previous run and hitting the chest earlier. After that, Mario collects the star. The optimal way to do this is to GP above it at the right time so you reach the bottom of its hitbox when it becomes collectible. ABC Strategy Since at least 2007, Treasure of the Ocean Cave was thought to be only completable with a singular A press, used to grab the star. [16]  However, in February of 2023, Tyler Kehne brought back an idea he once discarded due to issues with the joystick magnitude not allowing the strategy to work. He had an idea to get it to properly build suffecient speed, which was shortly after confirmed to be true, meaning that the star was completable in 0.5x A presses. There were a few dead-end strategies for this star before this: 0x Hyperspeed: Utilizing hyperspeed, it is theoretically possible to launch yourself onto the star, avoiding the need to jump. It was shown by pannenkoek2012 that 500 speed would be sufficient to reach the star. [17]  This speed requirement was subsequently lowered to 280 by Superdavo0001, [18]  and then to 262. [19]  Although significantly more feasible than 500, these speeds are notably above the maximum speed currently achievable in the course, which is around 160. A new hyperspeed method/application would be needed to make this work, otherwise, the speed needed would need to be greatly reduced again. Water Shell Cloning: Typically to clone with a water shell an instant loading zone is required, such as in Dire, Dire Docks. It was shown by bad_boot that a loading zone would not be needed if there was a way to activate timestop while keeping control of Mario in the course with a water shell. [20]  Cloning would allow Mario to clone either goombas or the star directly. If a timestop glitch existed in JRB this would solve the star, however, there is currently no known way to do this. Spawning Displacement/Speed Conservation into the Demo: Using spawning displacement/speed conservation, it is possible to desync Mario during the demo sequences. [21]  One of these sequences exist in JRB, opening the possibility. However, no way to activate the star, even with an ideal placement, has been found. Even if it would be, it seems feasibly unlikely to be possible within the constraints of the ABC.

{"prompt": "Explain Clone", "completion": "Mario holding a Coin Clone Cloning  refers to a number of glitches that allow Mario to hold  objects  that were not intended to be held. Typically, this happens when Mario continues to hold an  object slot  after the object in it has unloaded. When a new object loads into this slot, Mario will hold a reference to this new object. The name \"cloning\" comes from one of its main applications, which is to duplicate objects such as  coins  or  goombas . This name is a misnomer, as the duplication behavior is a property of those specific objects, and not the technique itself.    How holding objects works Contents 1   Methods 1.1   Delayed grab 1.2   Loading zones 2   Properties of clones 3   Applications 3.1   Duplication 3.2   Infinite shell 3.3   Remote star collection 4   Manipulating clones 4.1   Coin in BoB 4.2   Coin in BitFS 4.3   Top coin of a ring (AKA coin#3) 4.4   Bob-omb 4.5   Chain Chomp's Pivot 4.6   Red Coin Star 4.7   100 coin star 4.8   Koopa Shell 4.9   Metal Cap 5   Premature Cloning 6   See also 7   References Methods Delayed grab When Mario picks up an object by  punching  (as opposed to  diving  or  water grabbing ), there is a two- frame  window of time in which the object is not placed into  limbo , yet Mario has committed to picking up the object. At the end of this window, Mario will hold the object slot that this object is in, even if the original object has since unloaded. For example, if Mario begins to pick up a  Bob-omb  just before it explodes and unloads, Mario will hold the object slot that the Bob-omb originally occupied. This can be performed using the following objects: [1] Object Circumstances Before coins despawn After coins despawn Bob-omb No fuse VS2 VS3 Early fuse VS4/VS5 VS5/VS6 Full fuse VS2 VS3 Chuckya All VS21 Cork Box Breaking VS42 VS45 Disappearing within no-spawn radius VS1 Disappearing outside no-spawn radius VS2 Crazy Box [2] All VS21 Loading zones Loading zones  cause all objects to unload, and new objects to spawn in their place. If Mario is holding an object while passing through a loading zone, he will continue to hold the object slot, even though the object has unloaded. This can be performed in  Wet-Dry World  by carrying a  chuckya  or  Heave-Ho  through the loading zone, and in  Dire, Dire Docks  using the  water shell holding  glitch. Properties of clones The term \"clone\" generally refers to an object that was not meant to be held that nevertheless is or was being held by Mario. When Mario releases a clone, it stops updating and becomes unable to send signals to other objects. Mario can still  interact  with it, since interaction is part of Mario's behavior, not the object's. For example, while Mario can still collect a coin after it has been cloned, the coin no longer spins. Though Mario can still interact with objects, certain types of interactions will cause the object to become intangible, and thus he will no longer be able to interact with it in any way. These include: Collecting a coin Taking damage from an enemy Touching a  water ring Getting knocked back by a  Bully Touching a  warp  object Getting grabbed by  Chuckya  (or  King Bob-omb , who is impossible to clone) Some notable interactions that do  not  cause the object to become intangible are: Touching a  Koopa Shell Knocking back a Bully Warping using a  Teleporter The behavior of clones is identical to that of objects during  Time Stop . If an object that is meant to be held, like a Bob-omb or cork box, is cloned, it will act normally when released. It is not usually considered a clone and has behavior separate from its behavior during time stop. Applications Duplication Some objects such as  coins  and  Goombas  use  spawners , whose purpose is to ensure that these objects are loaded when necessary. For example, when Mario moves far away from a line of coins, they unload. When Mario again moves toward the coins, the  coin line's spawner  is responsible for respawning the coins, and only those coins, in the line that have not yet been collected. When Mario interacts with a coin, he collects it and sets a flag on the coin spawner to inform it that it has been collected. When the coin next updates, it despawns itself and informs the coin spawner that it should not be respawned when Mario moves away and comes back. However, if this coin was cloned, then it does not update, and so cannot inform the spawner that it has been collected. Thus, if Mario collects a cloned coin, and then moves away and returns, the original coin will respawn, effectively duplicating the coin. This does not occur with coins that do not come from spawners, as they cannot load during the level. The following objects can be duplicated in this manner: Goombas Yellow coins  (not  red coins , as these do not have spawners) Blue coins  by reaching a loading zone before the  Blue Coin Switch  runs out Because cloned objects never unload, they gradually fill up the available  object slots  and continue to be rendered on screen. This can cause lag,  game corruption , and eventually a  game freeze  when the object slots run out. Infinite shell When Mario rides on a  Koopa Shell  or  Shiny Shell , although the latter is impossible to clone, the shell object stays spawned until he runs into a  wall  or presses Z, which causes the shell to break. At this point, Mario sets a flag on the shell, and when the shell next updates, it unloads itself. Because a cloned shell does not update, it does not unload, allowing Mario to repeatedly ride and break a shell after cloning it.  Remote star collection Stars that spawn during the course of gameplay can be cloned. For example, this can be done with red coin stars, 100 coin stars, and stars contained in item boxes. Even if a star is spawned at the start of a level, it can still be cloned if that level contains a  loading zone , such as  Board Bowser's Sub  and  Collect the Caps  in  Dire, Dire Docks . Manipulating clones These are commonly used methods to get Mario to hold the correct  object slot  to clone a desired  object .

This occurs on the first frame a nearby spawner spawns objects that can be cloned, and on that frame, the object would temporarily be placed at the origin of the course (0, 0, 0) while many of the properties are missing. A clone of such an object mimics many of the same traits. Therefore, a premature clone would, if released, be placed at the origin of the course while missing some effects. For example, a coin released prematurely will not be collected while the object is released, unlike the standard steps of cloning a coin.

When trying to go faster on the star, keep in mind that lines are often just as important, or more important than what's shown on your speed display. That said, as a general rule, in order to optimize for speed on the shell you should keep 2 things in mind: Mario accelerates faster while grounded until speed 57, and while jumping for speeds greater than 57 Mario's grounded speed is capped at 63. Jumping allows you to exceed the cap, and chaining 1st frame jumps back to back allows you to build speed without reverting back to 63 when you land When riding on the shell, Mario's default forward speed is set to 24. Holding forward will allow you to eventually reach a speed cap of 63. As you'll notice in the mp4 below, the speed increases at a decelerating rate the faster you go.  Load video Local File Local File might collect personal data. Continue Dismiss https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/File:Shellnojump.mp4     No jumping However, when jumping while riding the shell Mario's speed will increase at a constant rate of 0.15 units every frame. Load video Local File Local File might collect personal data. Continue Dismiss https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/File:Shelljump.mp4     All jumping As it turns out, when Mario's forward speed reaches approximately 57, your acceleration is higher while jumping than while riding the shell on the ground. Mario's speed is capped at 63 while on the shell, however this can be bypassed by jumping. While in the air, Mario will accelerate until he touches the ground again where the speed resets back to 63. If a first frame jump is performed when landing your speed won't reset to 63 and you can gain more speed. Load video Local File Local File might collect personal data.

Continue Dismiss https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/File:Lll1001beginning.mp4     Beginning Red Coin Area The main variations between the strats for the Red Coin section of the star involve taking tighter lines while collecting coins. Keep in mind the Shell Mechanics explained above in determining when it makes sense to ride the shell grounded vs. jumping. Note that occasionally while playing on console, you'll experience about 20-30 frames of lag in the red coin area. Although there are some lag reduction strats, most of the this lag is unavoidable and due to RNG values associated with how Mr. I is spinning. In the mp4s below, the first 3 have bad rng and the last has good rng. Load video Local File Local File might collect personal data.

In the first example, Mario Cam is used for the coin ring on the 2nd bully platform and Lakitu Cam is used for Mr. I. If you're using this camera, it helps to make sure you input the C-Left at the beginning of the video before switching to Mario Cam. This will give you a good camera switch when you jump for Mr. I. In order to make Mr. I track you, Mario must be facing within approximately 45\u00b0 or lower of Mr. I's line of sight. Load video Local File Local File might collect personal data.

{"prompt": "Explain BLJ - Side BLJ", "completion": "The  Backwards  Long Jump  hyperspeed method, or  BLJ  for short, is the most famous  hyperspeed  method in Super Mario 64. Due to their versatility, BLJs are commonly used in all kinds of  speedruns  and  challenges . When Mario initiates a long jump, his horizontal speed is multiplied by 3/2. A BLJ occurs when a backwards long jump is interrupted before the effects of drag can counteract the speed gain from the 3/2 multiplier. This does not occur with forwards long jumps because long jumps have a \"hard cap\" of +48 horizontal speed which Mario's speed cannot exceed. No such cap exists in the negative direction because normally the \"soft cap\" of -16 speed from drag is easily enough to stop any speed gain. There are several different types of BLJs. The distinguishing feature of different types of BLJs is what they use to interrupt the long jump: Slope BLJs use slopes by going up the slope. Stair BLJs use stairs by going up the stairs. Elevator BLJs use the upwards movement of an elevator or other object. Side BLJs  use two floors at slightly different levels by oscillating between them. Ceiling BLJs use an exposed ceiling or low-hanging ceiling by making Mario hit his head and start travelling downwards faster. BLJs can also be  pause buffered  to increase the amount of long jumps that can be performed in a given amount of time or space. The BLJ glitch was patched in the  Shindou release , and therefore also the  iQue version . This also means that any emulator releases of these game versions lack the BLJ glitch, namely the  Japanese Wii VC release , the  Japanese Wii U VC release , and all versions of  Super Mario 3D All-Stars . Contents 1   Slope BLJ 2   Stair BLJ 3   Elevator BLJ 4   Side BLJ 5   Ceiling BLJ Slope BLJ A slope BLJ is performed by interrupting a backwards long jump using a rising slope. Because Mario usually lands immediately after long jumping (assuming a steep enough slope), slope BLJs are normally pause bufferable. Stair BLJ A stair BLJ is similar to a slope BLJ, except using stairs instead of slopes to achieve the rising floor effect. Stair BLJs often cannot be performed when there are wall hitboxes sticking out from the stairs because the walls prevent Mario from landing on the higher floor. Similarly to slope BLJs, stair BLJs are often pause bufferable. Stair BLJs are often used for bypassing doors in the castle. Elevator BLJ Elevator BLJs are also conceptually similar to slope BLJs and stair BLJs in that they too use the floor under Mario rising to interrupt Mario's long jump. Elevator BLJs use elevators as the rising floor. Elevator BLJs are a common solution for when one wishes to quickly get a lot of speed since while slope BLJs and stair BLJs can only last until the slope or stair runs out or Mario hits out-of-bounds, elevator BLJs can last as long as the elevator is moving and don't need to stop when Mario hits out-of-bounds. Because of this, elevator BLJs are the only type of BLJ that can reach  PU  speed. Side BLJ Side BLJs or SBLJs are the most complex type of BLJ. A side BLJ is performed by oscillating between two floors at slightly different heights to achieve an effect similar to a stair BLJ but without needing a long, wall-less staircase. Side BLJs are performed by first having Mario face slightly to the higher floor (so that when Mario's moving backwards, he moves down to the lower floor), then straining to the higher floor during the long jump so that Mario snaps up to it. After long jumping from the lower floor, Mario ends up on the higher floor due to the straining, but because of the direction Mario is facing he snaps down to the lower floor on the next frame. This can then be repeated. Because side BLJs require 1 extra frame per long jump for Mario to snap back down to the lower floor, they cannot be pause buffered. Ceiling BLJ A ceiling BLJ is performed by having Mario hit a ceiling during his long jumps so that Mario starts moving downwards earlier, meaning there's less time for drag to slow Mario down. Ceiling BLJs can be performed with low ceilings or with  exposed ceilings .  Lobby Backwards Long Jump  is an example of this type of BLJ. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp"}

When they see Mario, their fuse lights and they start chasing him. After their fuse ends, they explode, creating an explosion object. Contents 1   Locations 2   Bloated Bob-omb 2.1   Maintaining a Bloated State 2.2   Hands-free Teleported Bloated Bob-omb 2.3   Uses 3   Interaction with walls 4   Supersaturated Bob-omb 5   See also 6   References Locations The following courses have Bob-ombs: Bob-omb Battlefield Shifting Sand Land Tall, Tall Mountain Tick Tock Clock Rainbow Ride Bowser in the Fire Sea Bowser in the Sky Bloated Bob-omb The bloated Bob-omb is the state when the Bob-omb gets bigger, right before exploding. Usually, this Bob-omb explodes. But if you grab it right before the explosion, it will be delayed for 12 frames. Note that if the explosion is early (by throwing the Bob-omb on the ground) It won't explode until the timer expires. The explosion is delayed, but the Bob-omb stays big, which means that its hitbox is bigger, enough to push Mario backwards. Maintaining a Bloated State After grabbing the bloated Bob-omb, you have to walk, then the Bob-omb will start exploding again, then you have to re-grab the Bob-omb. During these small frames of walking, you will be able to turn. Another way of keeping it is by holding it  Hands-free . You will be able to jump, jumpkick, double jump, triple jump, and ground pound. You can't turn except if you have a  Wing Cap , where you will be able to fly while being pushed backwards. Hands-free Teleported Bloated Bob-omb If you teleport while holding a Bob-omb  Hands-free , This Bob-omb will disappear. But if you go close to the first teleporter or if you teleport back, the Bob-omb will appear in front of you, giving you backwards momentum while keeping almost every movement. You can grab that Bob-omb by diving or punching. Kicking will cancel the momentum. Uses This trick is used frequently in the  A Button Challenge , but also generally for clipping through walls, such as in  the Chain Chomp's Gate clip. Interaction with walls The game first adds the speed to the current position and uses that point in the collision calculations. The algorithm will push the bob-omb outward from the wall if a collision occurs, so if it's already against the wall it effectively adds the component of the bob-omb's speed that's tangent to the wall. Regardless of whether a collision occurs or not, the Bob-omb's position is incremented by its speed at a later point as well. Finally, since the point used for the collision calculation is only written to the Bob-omb's position if a collision occurs, the double speed increment doesn't happen in the open field. This occurs before the Bob-omb's actual movement step, so then it moves a 2nd time before the frame ends. Thus, when Bob-ombs touch a wall, their speed is effectively doubled. Basically, Bob-ombs always check for wall collision before moving. If they do collide with a wall hitbox, then the Bob-omb's position is incremented and pushed away by the wall. Supersaturated Bob-omb A supersaturated Bob-omb is a Bob-omb whose fuse timer has overflowed, which vastly delays its explosion. Because the underlying glitch takes 828 days (2.3 years) to execute, it is the most time-consuming glitch in the game.

You can help fix it . The  discussion page  may contain suggestions. An  object  is an entity in the game that is not part of the level geometry of the course. Most objects either interact with Mario and/or move in some way, act as stationary platforms or simply exist for aesthetic purposes. The maximum number of objects in a  course  is 240. Contents 1   Object Groups 2   Processing Order 3   Object limit 4   Trivia 5   See also 6   References Object Groups Every object is part of a larger \"group\" that helps define its behavior [1] . Of the 12 groups, some are more strongly defined than others, but they are still a useful tool to categorize objects in the game. Group Name Description Player Group The first group, this group is composed of \"playable\" characters, which is simply Mario. Had Luigi been finished, it's possible he would have been in this group. Group 2 This group is unused, it is possible this would have been a Luigi group, too. Destructive The destructive group consists of (non-playable) objects able to destroy other objects. This group consists specifically of four objects- Bob-omb, Bob-omb explosion, cork shell, and a beta object that was unused. Group 4 Like the second group, this one is also unused. General Actor This group contains most normal 'enemies' or actors ( MIPS ,  Bullet Bill ,  Bully , etc) Pushable This group consists of objects able to push other (non-playable) objects. This behavior often goes along with  transport cloning . This group consists of objects such as goomba, koopa, and spiny. Level This group consists of objects within levels that are interactable, such as hearts and stars. This group often acts as \"catch-all\" along with default. Group 7 Group 7 is another unused group. Default If an object isn't put into a different group, it ends up here. For this reason, this group acts as a \"catch-all\" for odd objects. Surface These are any items that have surface collision, specifically walls, floor, and ceilings. Often these are items that would be easy to consider just part of the course geometry, such as the submarine in DDD or ship in JRB. Worth noting- this group is a requirement to have surfaces, so objects like Whomp and Thwomp still fall into this category despite being \"actors\". Polelike The polelike group consists of objects that could be described as \"radial\" in that the attract Mario to some sort of radial center. This includes poles, whirlpools, tornados, trees, etc. Spawner This group consists of most objects that spawn other objects, like coin spawners or star spawners. Unimportant Unimportant objects generally do not affect gameplay at all and exist purely for visuals. This group has the unique quality of unloading to stay under the object limit, hence their \"unimportant\" name. Some examples include smoke, wind, and dust. Processing Order During a frame, object lists are processed in the following order: Spawner, Surface, Polelike, Player, Pushable, General, Destructive, Level, Default, Unimportant  [2] Object limit The  object limit  is the maximum number of important objects a course can have loaded simultaneously before the game cannot handle loading any more. This limit is 240 at all times, but the  debug  code that displays object count fails to count certain spawners which? , making this limit seem lower in some courses citation needed . This doesn't apply to the total objects in the course, only to ones that are loaded at the time. Unloaded objects use no slots. As the object limit is approached, unimportant objects will sacrifice their slots in order to empty them for important objects. If no vacant slots are available when any object (important or unimportant) is loaded, a  crash  will occur. Trivia Clones  never unload and thus occupy object slots even when the original object is unloaded. PUs  don't naturally contain any objects, but they can be brought there.

{"prompt": "Explain Speed", "completion": "Speed , often abbreviated as  SPD , is a type of internal variable that represents how many  units   Mario  moves per frame. There are many speed variables, such as Horizontal Speed (HS), Vertical Speed (VS), X/Y/Z Speed, Sliding Speed, and X/Z Sliding Speed. These variables do not always represent how much Mario  actually  moves per frame; for example, when something is in his way, Mario can have horizontal speed without going anywhere. See  De Facto Speed  for more. Gravity   Mario falling at  Terminal Speed  ( M75 )   in  PSS When  airborne , Mario's vertical speed decreases by 4 units every frame due to gravity, and is capped at -75 units per second. Speed Conservation The speed variables are normally updated every frame, but sometimes this is not the case. When outside of water and not sliding, Mario's sliding speed is constantly updated to whatever his horizontal speed is, and when in water, Mario's sliding speed isn't updated at all. Therefore, horizontal speed can be conserved by going into water and entering a sliding state on the same frame Mario exits (for example, by pressing Z to crouch) to activate his sliding speed. Some other examples of speed conservation are  Vertical Speed Conservation  and  Vertical and Horizontal Speed Conservation . Negative Speed Buildup The main reason why Mario is able to get massive amounts of negative speed so easily, is because although the game developers often hard capped Mario's positive speed, they usually just soft capped Mario's negative speed allowing Mario to get hundreds, thousands, or even millions of units of speed with tricks such as the  Backwards Long Jump ,  Hyperspeed Walking  and  Backward Shell Hyperspeed . This slight oversight is the main root of many speed-gaining tricks in the game. Although, it's worth noting that some sorts of Mario's positive speed (just as some other negative) have no cap at all, such as airborne accelleration of 0.15 units per frame^2 (which allows Mario to build positive speed with HSWK, pedro spot etc.).  But it is usually easier to build negative speed than positive one. For example, while  Long Jump  speed has both positive cap (48) and negative cap (-16), the positive one is hard capped (at the beginning of the long jump, it is immediatelly set to 48 if it's higher), while the negative one is soft capped (it is slowly increasing to -16 if it's lower (note: lower negative is further from zero, not closer)). That's why Mario can build speed while jumping backwards (BLJ), but not forwards.  The maximum amount of negative speed Mario is able to build up is approximately -3*10^38. At higher speeds, Mario's intended next position increases beyond the highest finite value the game can store his position in, and the game crashes."}

You can help fix it . The  discussion page  may contain suggestions. This article is in need of an image. You can help Ukikipedia by  adding images . A  ledge grab  works as follows: While Mario is falling with non-positive vertical speed, the game checks if there's a wall 30 units above him and that there's no wall 150 units above him. If this passes, then it considers a point 60 units towards the wall from Mario (i.e. 10 units into the wall) and 160 units above Mario. It then checks what the highest floor is from 78 units above that point to 100 units below that point. If a floor is found, then Mario grabs the ledge. Given these conditions, a ledge grab normally raises Mario between 30 units (inclusive) and 150 units (exclusive). However, it's possible to exploit this logic to do a glitchy ledge grab and raise Mario more than 150 units (though 238 units is the max possible raise). Glitchy ledge grabs are rarely possible in practice due to the fact that there cannot be a wall 150 units above Mario. Fortunately, even minor deviations from perfect geometry can cause there to be no wall 150 units above Mario.

{"prompt": "Explain Castle Movement", "completion": "Lakitu Skip  is the first trick runners must perform when doing a run in any category. On the castle moat bridge, Mario can land on the very edge and clear it without triggering Lakitu's dialogue.  Tips Lakitu Skip can be performed on either side of the bridge, but it is faster to do so on the left side. Select a setup that works best for you and stick to it in runs; the trick will become easier as your control over Mario improves. If you are new to the game, it is advised not to reset over missing Lakitu Skip; the ~8 seconds you save from it will not make or break your run until you get to a higher level.   Visual cue.

Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Suggested Routes It is important to note that although tricks are featured more prominently in this category than in  70 Star , better movement and consistency is still what makes the biggest difference.  As a beginner, it is recommended to start with a route that does not do LBLJ and improve on your fundamentals before switching to a harder, more reset-heavy LBLJ route. Beginner  -  No LBLJ Route without DW Reds Recommended for beginners with minimal experience Same as intermediate, but replaces Dark World Reds with Swimming Beast in the Cavern. Bowser in the Dark World (No Reds) Swimming Beast in the Cavern Intermediate  -  No LBLJ Route Recommended for newer players around the sub 20 level Advanced   -  LBLJ Route Recommended for advanced runners going for low 16/sub 16.

If you plan on taking this game seriously, it is recommended to learn DW Reds sooner than later, as it helps a lot with fundamentals. The differences from the standard route are as follows: Bowser in the Dark World No Red Coins Hazy Maze Cave A-Maze-ing Emergency Exit  HMC Toad  (spawns at 12 stars, do not get this last or MIPS will not spawn) Swimming Beast / Dorrie Rolling Rocks Advanced No LBLJ Route Variations There are several route variations for the No LBLJ route which are faster, but generally much harder. In almost every instance, these variations are only faster if you do the most optimal strats for each star; hence, they are recommended only for people running the No LBLJ category extension for top times (i.e. sub 16 minutes). If you are simply looking to optimize your 16 star route for the main leaderboards, it is recommended to switch to an LBLJ route.

{"prompt": "Explain Boo Hyperspeed", "completion": "Boo Hyperspeed  is a  hyperspeed method  where Mario builds up horizontal speed by repeatedly bouncing on two  Boos . By moving multiple Boos into a corner, Mario can bounce on them repeatedly to build up speed. This works because Mario's forward speed in uncapped while he is airborne and bouncing off multiple Boos will let him increase his speed while airborne. Due to Boo's forward speed being based on Mario's speed while chasing Mario, this can cause Boos to move rapidly if they begin to chase Mario, which can affect the process.

To complete it, Mario must enter the Sunken Ship, open the treasure chests in the correct order to lower the water level, and collect the  Power Star  inside the item box. Contents 1   A Button Challenge 2   TAS 2.1   TAS Strategy 2.2   TAS History 3   References A Button Challenge Mario swims through the water by punching in the water. This is very slow, so while Mario lures the eel out of the ship he collects a nearby  coin ring  to maintain his health. After lowering the water level, Mario heads as far up the ship as he can. He then walks up the rest of the way, utilizing the plank. In order to open the item box, Mario  frame walks  up the side of the ship until he is high enough. He stops walking, making him fall backwards, allowing him to ground pound, opening the box and collecting the star. TAS TAS Strategy Mario begins by heading left towards the  metal cap  box. He performs a long jump to open it, and as he lands, immediately does a jump dive in the opposite direction, collecting the cap and landing next to a rock. He utilizes the bottom of the rock which slopes inwards, to do a  BLJ . When he breaks free of the rock, Mario  pause buffers to get 2 more jumps . He moves right up to the wall. Beause Mario's next intended position is out of bounds, he doesn't move. Mario rotates so that he is parallel to the wall, moving his next position back in bounds, allowing him to move. Mario continues along the wall, his speed allowing him to clip through the rocks. When Mario approaches the water, he performs a  negative jump  into the water. He enters the water for 1 frame before he is  snapped to the top . In the 1 frame before Mario gets snapped up, Mario covers as much distance as possible, as once in the water, his speed is reduced greatly. Mario continues to travel backwards, falling slowly. He adjusts his angle so that he can move between the spikes, clipping past the corner of a spike, onto the other side. He walks down the steep slope and down into the bottom of the deep ocean. He doesn't fall off because when Mario is on a slope, his  speed is lowered  to ensure that he is always less than 100 units above the ground, which is the height which Mario snaps to the ground. Mario then walks to the ship and clips through its  wall  into the warp. Mario opens the 4 chests, narrowly getting the 1st one and using the wall on the 2nd and 3rd chests to help adjust his angle, and narrowly collecting the 4th one. He swims up, aiming for a slope to the right of the star box. When he reaches it, he walks into the water, which warps him back onto the slope due to its steepness, however since Mario is now facing forward, he can slide forward.

{"prompt": "Explain Behind Camera Anywhere", "completion": "Behind Camera Anywhere  is a technique discovered by ds273 [1]  that allows Mario to position himself so that he is no longer visible to the camera. Since the  HOLP  only updates when a held object is rendered, using the fact that the  camera  focus is a distance away from Mario, The camera can be faced away from Mario where he won't be rendered and so he can grab and throw a objects without updating the HOLP. This technique has been used as part of a method for the  Bowser in the Sky  pole skip.

Keep in mind that if there are any blue stars (uncollected) present in the star selection menu, then the last version that can be selected is the first blue star and not the stars after it: Version 1 : Accessed by selecting Star 1 through Star 4. There is no  shell . Version 2 : Accessed by selecting Star 5 through Star 6. The  shell  is found inside an item block on the starting platform. Coins The max amount of coins for this stage is 133, being split between outside and inside of the volcano (107 outside, 26 inside). This stage is also to home to possibly the most difficult non-glitchy coin in the game- a high bully in the volcano that requires a leap of faith to grab before it lands in the lava. There are no known methods of improving the max number of coins in this map.

Boil the Big Bully  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/NbUWR0IkNxE   As the course is filled with lava, Mario can go to higher platforms by simply using lava boosts. Therefore, Mario has no difficulty getting to the platform of the Big Bully and defeat it to collect the star. Bully the Bullies  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/_szjkqYGwkI   Mario goes to the platform with three bullies present and defeats all the bullies on the platform. The star is then collected by a lava boost nearby. 8-Coin Puzzle with 15 Pieces  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/4PXUXKf2ghU   Bowser's puzzle is reached by sliding kicking and dive-recovering. The eight coins on the puzzle are then quickly collected for the star to appear since the geometry of the course is mostly flat, easing navigation. Red-Hot Log Rolling  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/BxCJYoxELvk   As the shell is not available at this point, Mario must reach the log behind the steel-grate platform without a shell. After a couple of lava boosts, Mario gets on top of the log and rolls on it, and finally collects the star with a well-timed dive. Hot-Foot-It into the Volcano  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/Po3yFHGTieE   Mario enters the volcano. For the next two stars, Mario will utilize the lava boost from the \"lavafall\", but the major obstacle is how many lava boosts Mario can use without dying. Fortunately, a spinning heart is nearby allowing Mario to regain HP, allowing Mario to reach the destination with 0 A presses with a complicated route.  First, Mario gets on the moving platform with a lava boost and ZB bounces onto the lavafall (Mario is immune to lava effects when slide kicking) to land on the narrow bridge above with 2 lava boosts. Once there, Mario descends to the spinning platform and exploits the heart healing Mario's HP for an extended duration. Mario then moves back to the bottom of the lavafall quickly (since the higher platform is too high to reach) to go back to the higher platform with 3 lava boosts, restores HP with 3 coins, and quickly uses one more to reach the small platform with a pole. From there, Mario performs the final movement of ZB bouncing to the lavafall with height (while collecting 2 coins to restore HP) and uses 2 more lava boosts to reach Hot-Foot-It into the Volcano platform, collecting the star. Elevator Tour in the Volcano  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/IrXqE6DDt0I  (26 hours, non-Shindou only) Video:  https://youtu.be/i_2K_2UOcNM  (1 minute) A sequence of slow bully battery, fast bully battery, PU rotational displacement, then PU movement made the star possible in 0 A presses. This star still required 1 A press on Shindou versions of the game due to the bully death cancel being patched. However, a much faster strategy was found by using hyperspeed lava boosting to reach the star platform from the lavafall, which also worked on Shindou. LLL 100 coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/b3XxfYRYPHo   There are enough coins to collect outside the volcano, and so Mario collects most of the coins using a shell and grabs additional coins from bullies and Mr. I. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , every star except the two inside the volcano can be collected. They all utilize lava boosts to traverse between the platforms. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected, as it is impossible to escape the starting platform. In the  Pacifist Challenge , every star except for  Boil the Big Bully  and  Bully the Bullies  can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Red-Hot Log Rolling ,  Hot-Foot-It into the Volcano , and  Elevator Tour in the Volcano  can be collected. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: getting more coins than intended, cloning with the  Crazy Box , to reach a  Parallel Universe  in the main level, and dying in a vertical  PU . Cloning Since there is a  Crazy Box  in Lethal Lava Land, it is theoretically possible to make clones by dropping the Crazy Box and then grabbing it as it explodes. No method has been found to successfully accomplish this, however. The crazy box can be instant released by diving into the side of the platform it sits on, but currently efforts to move it to a place it can be grabbed have been unsuccessful. It is worth noting that grabbing the Crazy Box fake would not allow for any extra coins. Grabbing a fake Crazy Box results in the crazy box being destroyed without dropping any of its original coins, and without respawning, so if the fake box was used to clone a coin it would result in a net loss of 4 coins. Note that a ring of 8 coins is impossible to clone without a loading zone.

{"prompt": "Explain Object", "completion": "This article is in need of changes to meet Ukikipedia quality standards. This page is most likely lacking information or may contain inaccuracies.  You can help fix it . The  discussion page  may contain suggestions. An  object  is an entity in the game that is not part of the level geometry of the course. Most objects either interact with Mario and/or move in some way, act as stationary platforms or simply exist for aesthetic purposes. The maximum number of objects in a  course  is 240. Contents 1   Object Groups 2   Processing Order 3   Object limit 4   Trivia 5   See also 6   References Object Groups Every object is part of a larger \"group\" that helps define its behavior [1] . Of the 12 groups, some are more strongly defined than others, but they are still a useful tool to categorize objects in the game. Group Name Description Player Group The first group, this group is composed of \"playable\" characters, which is simply Mario. Had Luigi been finished, it's possible he would have been in this group. Group 2 This group is unused, it is possible this would have been a Luigi group, too. Destructive The destructive group consists of (non-playable) objects able to destroy other objects. This group consists specifically of four objects- Bob-omb, Bob-omb explosion, cork shell, and a beta object that was unused. Group 4 Like the second group, this one is also unused. General Actor This group contains most normal 'enemies' or actors ( MIPS ,  Bullet Bill ,  Bully , etc) Pushable This group consists of objects able to push other (non-playable) objects. This behavior often goes along with  transport cloning . This group consists of objects such as goomba, koopa, and spiny. Level This group consists of objects within levels that are interactable, such as hearts and stars. This group often acts as \"catch-all\" along with default. Group 7 Group 7 is another unused group. Default If an object isn't put into a different group, it ends up here. For this reason, this group acts as a \"catch-all\" for odd objects. Surface These are any items that have surface collision, specifically walls, floor, and ceilings. Often these are items that would be easy to consider just part of the course geometry, such as the submarine in DDD or ship in JRB. Worth noting- this group is a requirement to have surfaces, so objects like Whomp and Thwomp still fall into this category despite being \"actors\". Polelike The polelike group consists of objects that could be described as \"radial\" in that the attract Mario to some sort of radial center. This includes poles, whirlpools, tornados, trees, etc. Spawner This group consists of most objects that spawn other objects, like coin spawners or star spawners. Unimportant Unimportant objects generally do not affect gameplay at all and exist purely for visuals. This group has the unique quality of unloading to stay under the object limit, hence their \"unimportant\" name. Some examples include smoke, wind, and dust. Processing Order During a frame, object lists are processed in the following order: Spawner, Surface, Polelike, Player, Pushable, General, Destructive, Level, Default, Unimportant  [2] Object limit The  object limit  is the maximum number of important objects a course can have loaded simultaneously before the game cannot handle loading any more. This limit is 240 at all times, but the  debug  code that displays object count fails to count certain spawners which? , making this limit seem lower in some courses citation needed . This doesn't apply to the total objects in the course, only to ones that are loaded at the time. Unloaded objects use no slots. As the object limit is approached, unimportant objects will sacrifice their slots in order to empty them for important objects. If no vacant slots are available when any object (important or unimportant) is loaded, a  crash  will occur. Trivia Clones  never unload and thus occupy object slots even when the original object is unloaded. PUs  don't naturally contain any objects, but they can be brought there.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Big Boo's Haunt)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way. No Joystick Allowed The 100 coin star is currently used to reset Mario's ascent of steep slopes, which is useful near the top of the pyramid in  Shifting Sand Land  to collect the stars  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  and  Pyramid Puzzle .

{"prompt": "Explain Pendulum", "completion": "Pendulum Hitbox Info Hitbox Damage none Damage without hat none Tangibility radius 1500 Interaction type none Surfaces floor: , wall: , ceil: Related Cog ,  Treadmill ,  Spinner Found In Tick Tock Clock Pendulum s are  objects  found in  Tick Tock Clock . The pendulum swings and is dependent on the  setting of the clock . Contents 1   Behavior 1.1   Still Setting 1.2   Fast Setting 1.3   Slow Setting 1.4   Random Setting 2   References Behavior The pendulum starts at angle = 6371.5557 (35 degrees) on the still setting and angle = 6500 on all other settings. From there, the pendulum behaves differently on all four clock settings. Still Setting The pendulum is still on the still setting. Fast Setting The pendulum swings fast on the fast setting. Slow Setting The pendulum swings slow on the slow setting. Random Setting The pendulum swings with an angular acceleration of 13 or 42, randomly, on the random setting. When a swing didn't pass angle=0 (when the pendulum points straight down), and subsequent swings swap angular accelerations, every swing will have a different amplitude. By manipulating RNG, the pendulum can be made swing with a TASer's desired acceleration. Alternating acceleration 13 and 42 until the pendulum hits angle=0, then manipulating acceleration to keep the acceleration the same value for all future swings, allows the pendulum to swing much farther than it was intended to; this is known as  Pendulum Manipulation . A set of swing amplitudes that are connected by swings of alternating accelerations usually starts and ends with two equal and opposite swings that both pass angle=0. When placed in increasing order, these sets of swing amplitudes form the shape of a ladder and are called the steps of the ladder and the swings that pass angle=0 are called rail amplitudes, forming the rails of the ladder. The acceleration that allows them to pass angle=0, and the frames it takes to reach angle=0 are indices of the rail. Sometimes, a rail is sandwiched by two different rail amplitudes. This forms a bridge between the two rail amplitudes.

It can be accessed from the painting in the room located on the right side of the lower first floor of Princess Peach's castle. This course is typically fast and is often the first course completed in runs (due to BoB's near requirement for wing cap).

[1]  Entering this level can also be done without the use of the A button, [2]  and most likely 2 presses for the  ABZ / Buttonless Challenge . Entering this level the first time also triggers textboxes, which costs the ABZ/Buttonless Challenge at least 4 presses. (This is yet to be shown on video.) Course Versions This course has three versions- Version 1 : Accessed by selecting Star 1. This version contains King Whomp at the top of the course. Version 2 : Accessed by selecting Star 2. This version contains a fortress built on top of the course. Version 3 : Accessed by selecting Star 3 through Star 6. Bob-omb buddy is present to open the cannon, and an owl can be summoned from the tree near the starting point. The fortress is still present. Coins Whomp's Fortress has a total of 141 coins collectible without the utilization of glitches, with most coins coming from coin spawners. This course has two different coin duplication glitches, however, that push the maximum beyond 141 coins-  cloning  and the  breaking-disappearing cork box glitch . Both of these utilize the cork boxes in the level, and can both take the maximum over the max in-game coin score of 255. The breaking-disappearing cork box glitch pushes the bounds a bit farther, though, and allows 999 to be collected in course.

Entering Whomp's Fortress  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/mlHzqJn2SMs?t=33s   This part is easily done without pressing  A  by using a dive recover into the painting. Chip Off Whomp's Block  (0x) New strategy Video:  https://youtu.be/ZIje_PpDeIc This strategy uses precise movement to dive recover into a misalignment on King Whomp right after he falls. Because King Whomp still has a yaw velocity for a few frames after he falls, Mario can get displaced off the misalignment, activating vertical speed, allowing him to ground-pound King Whomp without the help of the elevator. King Whomp can be manipulated so that when he falls for the third time, the misalignment is close to where the star spawns. Therefore, after Mario ground-pounds King Whomp for the third time, he is high enough to collect the star immediately, without cloning. Original strategy Video:  https://youtu.be/7ZwwAemsbYQ   The trickiest part is collecting the star, since it hovers at 296 units above the ground [4] , too high to be reached by dive recovering. While it might seem impossible to reach the star unless an A press is used to jump, Mario can fortunately collect it by cloning. By bringing a fake cork box up and defeating King Whomp, Pannenkoek is able to clone the star and collect it by holding Vacant Slot 41 (VS41). To the Top of the Fortress  (0x) Main article:  To the Top of the Fortress New strategy Video:  https://youtu.be/nHx7r6T9ROA Before entering the stage, the  HOLP  needs to be set at a specific location in  Cool, Cool Mountain . This is done using a penguin. Upon entering the stage, Mario first collects 99 coins. He then dives from a floating island to the bottom of the course, barely taking large  fall damage . This allows him to use  pause-buffered hitstun  to remotely throw a cork box onto the big platform at the top of the course, the cork box then breaks on the bullet bill blaster. Mario climbs to the top using the elevator, spawns a 100 coin star from a cork box's coin and uses it to  Star Dance Clip  onto the bullet bill blaster. Mario  dive grinds  to build up speed and recovers into a misalignment on a tower platform. From here, he climbs up the tower and collects the star. Original strategy Video:  https://youtu.be/M4M_OyUorRQ   The Wing Cap and the Metal Cap need to be unlocked in order to use the  Hat in Hand  glitch in  BoB  and WF. Before entering the stage, the  HOLP  needs to be set at a specific location in  Bob-omb Battlefield . Upon entering the stage, Mario starts collecting many coins in order to spawn the 100-coin star at the right moment. The Metal Cap is collected twice to activate the hat-in-hand object displacement glitch. Using the glitch, Mario carries the cork box up the mountain (during which he throws the cork box multiple times and catch it while it is falling down from the HOLP to speed up the process). Using clever tricks, he is then able to pick up the cork box during the time he is ascending from the elevator, and he collects all the coins from the floating island. At this point, Mario has 99 coins. The box is then thrown to appear from the HOLP and break next to the tower, exposing the 100th coin at the desired location. Mario collects it, spawning the star next to one of the tower's steps. Mario dives down to the lower part of the course, grabbing the second cork box, and bringing it upwards. At the top floor, with precise movements, Mario remotely throws the cork box, stores 26 vertical speed on the elevator by canceling a dive recover on the steep part of it, allowing the cork box to push him off to reactivate the stored speed, ground pounding to gain height next to a platform of the tower (where the 100-coin star is), and then grabbing on the ledge while collecting the 100-coin star using  Star Dance Clip . After the collecting the star, Mario then climbs up the rest of the tower and collects  To the Top of the Fortress . For both times going up, Mario has to hold a cork box frame-walking up a slope. With very precise movements, Mario can carry the box and bounce on the ground to reach the elevator [5]  instead of having to drop the box at the HOLP and pick it up later on the arrow platform. Shoot into the Wild Blue  (0x) Video 1 (original strat):  https://youtu.be/CA-EZx_kunY   Video 2 (faster strat):  https://youtu.be/-Usau9dZJO4 The star can be collected by going from the top. Using the secret teleporter at the corner of the platform where the Metal Cap is located, Mario can teleport to a higher floor above where the star is located. Mario then drops down to collect the star. The faster strat uses an  Eru Drop  instead of a double turnaround to collect the star. Red Coins on the Floating Isle  (0x) Video 1 (original strat):  https://youtu.be/E6J71oX8o78   Video 2 (faster strat):  https://youtu.be/sqiZTyGX2ds All coins are reachable without pressing A. Fall onto the Caged Island  (0x) Video 1 (original strat):  https://youtu.be/mXy8Wlw3sRU   Video 2 (faster strat):  https://youtu.be/psNg9MFr5eo This star is done without pressing A by using  Version 1  of the course where King Whomp is present (Chip Off Whomp's Block). By manipulating the location and angle of King Whomp, Mario can land on top of Whomp and perform a dive recover onto the caged platform. Blast Away the Wall  (0x) Video 1 (original strat):  https://youtu.be/wdD21gnJ_rI   Video 2 (faster strat):  https://youtu.be/F-Vcl_CEd-w With a ledge-grab glitch very well-known in  RTA speedrunning , it is already known that using the cannon to shoot open the wall is completely unnecessary. All Mario has to do is grabbing the ledge where the star is located using a specific angle. WF 100 Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/anKoV6eZBi8   In a full game run of 120 stars, this star will already be collected while doing  To the Top of the Fortress . That being said, the star can still be collected without pressing A when done in isolation, with no difficult tricks required. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge , with  Blast Away the Wall  completed less conventionally by using a precise ledge grab in order to avoid the use of cannon. In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In a  No Buttons Allowed  challenge,  Shoot into the Wild Blue  and  Blast Away the Wall  can be collected. [6] In a  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. [7] In the  Pacifist Challenge , every star except for  Chip off Whomp's Block  can be collected in isolation. However,  To the Top of the Fortress  can not be collected in a full-game run since it is impossible to select. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 3 Z presses, all used to ground pound the Whomp King. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Shoot into the Wild Blue ,  Fall onto the Caged Island , and  Blast Away the Wall  can be collected in isolation. However, Whomp's Fortress cannot be entered at all in a full-game run because it requires talking to Lakitu.

It is collected by defeating the  Big Boo  that spawns upon defeating the five small Boos. A Button Challenge Video:  https://youtu.be/Z6Azdf3V2rU   It is possible to get this star with  0 A presses . Mario needs to defeat all boos on the first floor and defeat King Boo to collect the star at the entrance to the second floor accessed by a rising staircase. The main technique that allows Mario to access the second floor without jumping is the use of  Vertical Speed Conservation  (VSC) due to Mario's vertical speed not resetting to zero upon landing. Therefore, by making Mario land while he is still ascending, Mario can retain positive vertical speed, and the speed can be reactivated if Mario does not move at all except punching and breakdancing. Therefore, Pannenkoek takes advantage of the rising steps, which allows Mario to store vertical speed, punch to the edge of the step to reactivate the stored speed, and ledge-grab onto the second floor. The star is 281 units above the floor [2] , barely reachable by dive-recovering.

{"prompt": "Explain Spawning Displacement", "completion": "Spawning displacement  is a technique that allows  Mario  to receive displacement from a moving platform for one  frame  when spawning, hence the name. It is exclusive to the original  Japanese version . Spawning displacement occurs when Mario exits the level (such as through the pause menu, through death, through a warp, or by getting a star) and ends up standing on a moving object for one frame, whether it be an object from the previous level that was moving and unloaded (\"Normal\" Spawning Displacement) or an object in the  castle  that overwrote the object Mario was standing on while exiting the level (\"Reverse\" Spawning Displacement). In other words, Spawning Displacement occurs when exiting a level while standing on either a moving  object  which will not be overwritten by a non-moving object after  unloading  or an object which gets overwritten by a moving object after unloading. Spawning displacement results in Mario being displaced from his typical spawning position. [1] Contents 1   Applications 2   Variations 2.1   Teleport Displacement 2.2   Platform Release Displacement 3   References Applications Mario can utilize spawning displacement to re-enter  Tick Tock Clock  without pressing the A button. This is done by standing on a  spinner  and collecting a Star. Once the spinner rotates, it displaces Mario to spawn lower in the clock, landing on the edge of the clock next to the painting, thereby saving the A press needed to enter TTC. This is done three times in the 120 star run, saving three A presses due to the strict requirements only being applicable with three stars: Stop Time for Red Coins  by standing on a spinner and cloning the star. [2] The Pit and the Pendulums  by kicking a  wall  as he collects the star, to land on the spinners below. [3] Get a Hand  by kicking a wall as he collects the star, to fall towards the spinners below. [4]  A push from a  wall overlap  on the pendulum below the star is required to get enough distance for Mario to ledge grab onto the spinner. Variations Spawning displacement actually would occur on all versions of the game, but the displacement is overwritten before it can have an effect. This happens regardless of what causes the displacement. Simply standing on a moving platform (spawning displacement) has this effect, but so do some other things. Teleport Displacement Teleport displacement  is a different type of platform displacement that is not exclusive to the Japanese version. To perform it,  clone  a teleport point near a moving object so that said object will move after Mario has initiated the teleport. As a result, Mario will be displaced from the teleport's destination. Due to these very rare conditions, this can only be performed in  Wet-Dry World , since this is the only level in which you can clone a teleporter (via  loading zone ) that has a moving platform. [5] Platform Release Displacement Platform release displacement  is displacement that occurs for one frame after releasing a platform. Since platforms cannot normally be held, they must be cloned. Because  falling blocks  in  Whomp's Fortress ,  Big Boo's Haunt , and  Bowser in the Fire Sea  and the octagonal rotating platform in  Wet-Dry World  are the only platforms that can be cloned, these are the only ones that can cause platform release displacement. Since this displacement occurs from the new location of the platform, releasing it remotely at the  HOLP  can cause a very large displacement, which can even cause Mario to enter a  vertical PU .

Entering Shifting Sand Land  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/mlHzqJn2SMs?t=2m13s   The painting disguised as a wall can be entered by dive-recovering into it. In the Talons of the Big Bird  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/ww82yJUtnok   Near one of the four pillars, there is a crazy box nearby, which Mario can grab at the right moment to touch Klepto once the crazy box is at its peak. Mario then grabs the star. Shining Atop the Pyramid  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/9LUnFXtny2U   Using the same crazy box, Mario aims towards the top of the pyramid instead and swiftly grabs the star there. Even without this strategy, the star can still be reached by twirling from a Shy Guy and then walking up the pyramid while burned by a Keronpa Ball. Inside the Ancient Pyramid  (1x) Video:  https://youtu.be/-7rhANlmuDE   Navigating up the pyramid from the bottom (standard) entrance to the top costs 1 A Presses [2]  using known strategies, but it is faster to complete by entering the pyramid from the top. Unfortunately, the barriers around the elevator are 7 units too high for a dive recover to clear, and therefore an A press must be used to jump out of the elevator. Mario jumps from the elevator th the star. Stand Tall on the Four Pillars  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/Lh0HKRw1p5E?si=Br345uF-bfsKv6HR The biggest obstacle is to get to Eyerok's boss fight without pressing A. To do so, Mario needs to get on top of the wire mesh to access the teleporter via wrong-warping (the teleporter is intended to be one-way, but it can be activated by standing on a slightly higher ground). That way, Mario can enter the room from above, normally accessed by standing on top of the four pillars and riding down on the elevator. To get onto reach the wire mesh, Mario uses a precise goomba bounce. Free Flying for 8 Red Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/53yVvpNQHQg   The most difficult red coins to collect is the four midair red coins, one of which being closest to Mario is the hardest to get, as it is not far enough to be reached by a shy guy or a crazy box alone. The extra tornadoes do not spawn until this star is completed. However, with better strategies manipulating a Shy Guy, Mario can get it to appear at the right location and keep it at a lunging state with the crazy box's bounce, allowing it to move higher than intended. Mario then bounces on it from the peak of the crazy box, collecting the red coin while twirling. Without this strategy, Pokey clones would have been required. The remaining red coins in the air can be collected using a combination of tornadoes and shy guys. The location where the star is spawned is almost off-limits for Mario to reach as it requires a shy guy that is used up for the first coin. The fastest way for Mario to collect it is to clone the star. Nonetheless, even without cloning, Mario can still reach the high platform by precisely bouncing on a goomba and a pokey  [3] . Pyramid Puzzle  (1x) Video:  https://youtu.be/p4URidbSP88   Just like Inside the Ancient Pyramid, navigating up the pyramid from the bottom (standard) entrance to the top costs 1 A Presses [2]  using known strategies, but it is faster to complete by entering the pyramid from the top. Unfortunately, the barriers around the elevator are 7 units too high for a dive recover to clear, and therefore an A press must be used to jump out of the elevator. After jumping from the elevator, Mario just collects all the secrets and collects the star. SSL 100 coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/92LrcsRjTLI   Collecting various coins. Mario can opt to clone the box for more coins and eventually reach 100 coins without having to enter the pyramid. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected.  Pyramid Puzzle  requires precise jump kicks over the five coins to collect the secrets without touching the coins. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected.  Free Flying for 8 Red Coins  requires using  Fly Guys  and  Tornados  to reach the high red coins. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  In the Talons of the Big Bird ,  Shining Atop the Pyramid , and  Free Flying for 8 Red Coins  can be collected. They make heavy use of twirls from Fly Guys and Tornados. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , every star except for  Stand Tall on the Four Pillars  can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Shining Atop the Pyramid  and  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  can be collected. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to reach a  Parallel Universe  in the  Eyerok  boss room.

{"prompt": "Explain Gravity", "completion": "Gravity is the general idea of accelerating towards a center of mass, often \"down\". In Mario 64, this is less consistent than real life and depends significantly on the object and the situation. This could be an acceleration or more of a velocity depending on the situation. Mario Mario generally does a series of checks and changes his velocity depending on the situation. Once Mario performs any changes to his vertical speed, he is done with gravity and applies no more changes. If Mario is in the  twirling  action and has negative Y-speed: If Mario is spinning with a yaw speed faster than 1024: Mario's terminal velocity is set to -75 * 1024 / Mario's yaw speed. Mario's vertical speed is increased by -4 * 1024 / Mario's yaw speed. Otherwise: Mario's terminal velocity is set to -75. Mario's vertical speed is decreased by 4. If Mario's vertical speed is less than his terminal velocity, it is set to the terminal velocity instead. Mario now stops these gravity checks. If Mario is in the  shot from cannon  action: Mario's vertical speed is decreased by 1. If Mario's vertical speed is less than -75, it is capped/set to -75. Mario now stops these gravity checks. If Mario is in the  long jump ,  slide kick , or  BBH enter spin  actions: Mario's vertical speed is decreased by 2. If Mario's vertical speed is less than -75, it is capped/set to -75. Mario now stops these gravity checks. If Mario is in the  lava boost  or  fall from star grab  actions: Mario's vertical speed is decreased by 3.2. If Mario's vertical speed is less than -65, it is capped/set to -65. Mario now stops these gravity checks. If Mario is in the  getting blown  action: Mario's vertical speed is decreased by some number that is set elsewhere. If Mario's vertical speed is less than -75, it is capped/set to -75. Mario now stops these gravity checks. If Mario has the 0x100 flag, his action does not have the \"invulnerable\" or \"intangible\" but has the \"control jump height\" action flags, his vertical speed is more than 20, and A is not held: Mario's vertical speed is set to a quarter of its value. Mario now stops these gravity checks. If Mario's action has the \"metal water\" flag (metal cap and underwater): Mario's vertical speed is decreased by 1.6. If Mario's vertical speed is less than -16, it is capped/set to -16. Mario now stops these gravity checks. If Mario has the wing cap, A is held, and Mario's vertical speed is negative: Mario's animation is changed Mario's vertical speed is decreased by 2. If Mario's vertical speed is less than -37.5, it is increased by 4. Then if Mario's vertical speed is more than -37.5, it is capped/set to -37.5. Mario now stops these gravity checks. If Mario is still in these checks: Mario's vertical speed is decreased by 4. If Mario's vertical speed is less than -75, it is capped/set to -75."}

{"prompt": "Explain Surface", "completion": "A  surface  or  triangle  in Super Mario 64 is a piece of geometry that exerts some kind of force or effect on Mario. Every triangle falls into one of three categories: a floor triangle, a wall triangle, or a ceiling triangle. However, a triangle does not store what category it is. Instead, its category is determined based on the y component of the triangle's  normal vector [1] . If y component > 0.01, then it is a floor. If y component < -0.01, then it is a ceiling. Otherwise, it is a wall. Contents 1   Walls 1.1   Hitbox 1.2   Non-vertical walls 2   Floors 2.1   Hitbox 3   Ceilings 4   Surface Types 5   References Walls A triangle is a wall triangle if and only if -0.01 < normal.y < 0.01. Hitbox   The hitbox of a wall during both the initial handle and a ground quarter step, simplified   The hitbox of a wall during an air quarter step, simplified   The hitbox of a wall in the water, including both the inital handle and the single frame movement, simplified All wall hitboxes are handled once per  frame  and once per  quarter step  of Mario's movement. Most of the time, a wall has two separate hitboxes handled one after the other within a frame or quarter step. A wall hitbox's initial frame handle has a hitbox extending 50  units  forward and 50 units backward, offset down 60, and then a hitbox extending 24 units in each direction offset down 30. A quarter step of ground movement has a hitbox extending 24  units  forward and 24 units backward, offset down 30, and then a hitbox extending 50 units in each direction offset down 60. This is the opposite order from the initial handle, but the outcome is the same. A quarter step of air movement gives the wall a hitbox of 50 units in each direction offset down 150, and then a hitbox of 50 units offset down 30. Water movement does not implement quarter steps. After one frame of water movement, a wall hitbox extends 110 units in each direction, offset down 10. Since both the water handle and the initial handle both happen once per frame, the hitboxes can be overlaid. Non-vertical walls   This wall in  BoB  is not quite vertical.  The majority of walls in the game are perfectly vertical, but not all. Walls that are not vertical are one cause of  Glitchy Ledge Grabs . Floors A floor triangle is a triangle with normal.y > 0.01. Hitbox A floor's hitbox extends 78 units below and 100 units above the floor triangle. This allows Mario to move vertically along floors; if he is moving up or down a slope or stairs, he will be off the floor after his horizontal motion but still in its hitbox, which will snap him to the floor. He will always be snapped up if he's in a floor's hitbox below the floor, but he'll only be snapped down while above a floor if he is in a ground movement state. When walking on a slope, Mario will move horizontally at a rate slower than his actual speed, known as his  De Facto Speed . Any location that is not inside or above a floor hitbox is considered out of bounds; Mario will not be able to move into it of his own volition, and if forced into it, he will die. Ceilings A ceiling hitbox extends from 160 units below the ceiling to infinitely above. For ground and air movement, the ceiling will try its best to keep Mario out of it. If Mario walks into the ceiling, his quarter step will be canceled, and he will remain in place and do the pushing animation. If Mario is moving upwards in the air when coming in contact with the ceiling, his quarter step will be canceled and his vertical speed will be set to 0. On the contrary, when Mario falls onto a ceiling while airborne, his quarter step will be canceled and his horizontal speed will get set to 0, making him fall straight down. Although a ceiling will extend upwards infinitely, a floor can overwrite the ceiling hitbox, meaning that its hitbox will stop right when the floor hitbox starts. On the American release of the game, there is an interesting ceiling example found in  Rainbow Ride , where  the top of the chimney is not capped off , making the ceiling go up forever, softlocking Mario if he ends up sliding into it. Even though ceilings try to push Mario outwards, they can still be accessed using various techniques, such as getting pushed by an enemy. Note that once Mario is standing inside the ceiling, he is no longer able to move anywhere due to his quarter steps being cancelled.  For Water movement, Mario instead gets warped downward by ceilings. These downwarps are used in various TASes and speedruns. Surface Types While the surface type of a surface is not restricted to only floors, walls, or ceilings, in practice they are only used in certain scenarios, or wouldn't have any affect if such surface was of a different type, i.e. there could be a vertical wind ceiling or a death barrier wall, but those surfaces would have the behaviour.

{"prompt": "Explain Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch", "completion": "By causing a  Cork Box  to break and disappear from inactivity at the same time, it will create 3 coins and still respawn. This procedure can be repeated indefinitely for infinite coins, because unlike cloning, it leaves no objects that build up over time. This glitch was discovered by  pannenkoek2012 . This glitch is most commonly combined with the  hat-in-hand glitch , which will allow Mario to drop the box in any location by pressing Z without having to be near. This allows for placing the box inside another object that would break it, but only enter that object's  Tangibility Radius  one frame before the box despawns.

The first time  Super Mario 64  was shown was at the  Shoshinkai show in November of 1995 , with the introduction of the Nintendo 64 (Ultra 64 at the time). Early footage of the show revealed the 50% complete beta version of  Super Mario 64 , in which it looked completely different than what the final product looked like. [1]  The final product was supposed to come out in December, but it was delayed further, and the entire game was rebuilt. On May 16th, 1996 (E3 1996) the game was shown off and is almost like the final game. [2]  The entire game was almost accessible, some details got changed before the release, such as the different star icon in the HUD, a rock spike at the top of the mountain in  Bob-omb Battlefield , and other small details that were changed. The game was rushed at the end of development as told by one of the programmers of  Super Mario 64 , and a couple of the team members never wanted to make games anymore due to being burnt out after working on  Super Mario 64 . [3]  The game was released in Japan on June 23rd 1996, then on September 29th, 1996 in North America, and finally on March 1st, 1997 in Europe. Game Versions There are many different versions of the game, differing by where, when, how, and in what way they were released. N64 The Nintendo 64 console is less robust than modern consoles, so its CPU is more likely to crash when confronted by errors and other unforeseen occurrences. Japanese The very first version of the game to be commercially released, the Japanese N64 version was succeeded by the  Shindou  version a year after release. The Japanese version has a few glitches that were later fixed in all other versions, such as  spawning displacement ,  the lack of a coin limit ,  time stop  and others. It is also notable for being the fastest version of the game for the  1 Key  category (and some others). This is because the text takes longer, but the lack of narration makes the game shorter. The text in the first Bowser fight is avoided during the 1 Key run, so the Japanese version becomes faster. English See also:  Version Differences The English version and all successive versions added some extra dialogue over the Japanese version. For example, Mario does not say \"Haha\", and Peach does not narrate her \"Dear Mario\" letter. In addition, she does not talk during the ending. It fixes some errors and glitches from the previous version, such as the lack of a coin limit. It has, in general, less text than the Japanese version, but takes longer during the intro and ending due to Peach's narration. PAL The European release of  Super Mario 64  supports language changing in the settings menu between English, French, and German. This is optimal for the  ABZ Button Challenge  because the Start button can be used to change language and the language with the least text can be selected. Due to  Wii VC Round-To-Zero , however, the true optimal PAL version is not on N64. Outside of ABZ, PAL is little-used because changing languages wastes time and English is effectively identical if you do not change languages. Because of the PAL video format using 50hz instead of NTSC's 60hz, PAL runs at 25  frames  per second rather than 30, another reason why it is suboptimal for speedruns/TASes. Shindou The final release of  Super Mario 64  on the Nintendo 64 was once again released in Japanese. It enabled a compiler flag to allow optimizations, which results in less lag. It also fixed the infamous  Backwards Long Jump  glitch, which is why it is rarely used in speedruns, except in the  BLJless  category. Strangely, when grabbing a  pole  on this version, horizontal speed affects Mario's angle. The game introduced new voice clips like \"Bye, bye!\" when throwing Bowser. Some of Mario's voice clips are high-pitched in this version. This version would later be used for Super Mario 3D All-Stars. iQue (Chinese) Main article:  Super Mario 64 (iQue) The iQue version of the game runs on the iQue Player, a rare handheld N64 variant only released in China. The iQue version is in fact the Shindou version translated to Chinese, and as such it does not have BLJs or the Bob-omb or Bully angle crashes. By hacking a romhack by Kaze onto an iQue, it was found that the camera going to a  Parallel Universe  does crash the game like on the N64 console. [4] 64DD Version Super Mario 64  DD Version or SM64DD (called Super Mario Disk Version on the title screen) was an unreleased version of the game for the 64DD, likely made to test the load times of the system. The 64DD was a commercial failure, and the DD version was never released. Only one known copy of this version exists, owned by adonfjv, who found it at a Japanese video game store in 2014 [5] . The ROM (NDD) of this version has since been dumped. SM64DD is effectively the Japanese version of SM64 ported to the 64DD, with most (but not all) sounds replaced with their PAL versions. For example, the red coin and the sliding star door sounds are the same as in the Japanese release. The title screen is vastly different, resembling the hidden debug mode's level select screen. Since it is on a disk, load times are increased. The most major difference is that entering the inside of the island in  Tiny-Huge Island , where Wiggler and red coins reside, will crash the game. This makes collecting all 120 stars impossible on this version. The crash is console only, and occurs due to Wiggler's health value being uninitialized (the original Japanese and USA releases do not crash from this programming oversight as a coincidence). Wii VC Main article:  Virtual Console The Wii acts differently from the N64. It is much less likely to crash. Unlike the N64, it does not crash from  PU crashes ,   Bully angle crash , or Bob-omb angle crash. The emulation software also  rounds floats differently  from other consoles. Another difference is that it does not crash from the  Address Error Exception . It is currently unknown whether the Wii crashes upon having infinity speed. Japanese Japanese Wii VC is actually the Shindou edition, not the original Japanese version. This is why it does not have spawning displacement or other Japanese N64-exclusive glitches, nor does it have BLJs. It is almost never used for speedrunning for that reason. English English Wii VC is the optimal Wii VC for speedruns. It avoids the lack of BLJs in the Japanese version and the slower framerate of the PAL version. It is used for the  A Button Challenge  any% run because  Bowser in the Fire Sea  takes 0 A presses instead of 1 due to a rounding error. PAL PAL Wii VC is rarely seen because it is obscure and slow. However, it is actually the ideal game version for the ABZ Button Challenge, at least for any%, because it contains both language switching and the rounding error in BitFS. Wii U VC Main article:  Virtual Console The Wii U Virtual Console version has no known interesting glitches that set it apart from either N64 or Wii VC. It is identical to Wii VC, except that the rounding error is absent. Like Wii VC, it ignores  Address Error Exceptions . Wii U VC is often joked by speedrunners for have a high amount of input lag and it is mostly used only by new runners. Japanese Much like Wii VC, Japanese Wii U VC is the Shindou version. This means that BLJs and other glitches that were patched in the Shindou version are absent.  English Also like Wii VC, American Wii U VC is the US version. PAL PAL Wii U VC is actually the US version (unlike on Wii VC), so it's identical to the US Wii U VC. [6] Switch Super Mario 3D All-Stars Super Mario 3D All-Stars  includes an upscaled  Super Mario 64 . The version is the Shindou version with Lua scripts to hack in English text, new upscaled textures, and slight changes to accommodate the Switch control scheme (for example, \"PRESS +\" on the Mario head screen instead of \"PRESS START\"). [7]  The Switch does not have  the Wii's rounding error , but it does ignore  Address Error Exceptions . Nintendo Switch Online Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack includes  Super Mario 64  as part of the Nintendo 64 emulated games. Unlike  Super Mario 3D All-Stars , the Nintendo Switch Online version still has BLJs. [8] Super Mario 64 DS Main article:  Super Mario 64 DS Super Mario 64 DS  is a remake of  Super Mario 64  for the DS. Its physics are vastly different and there is no evidence that it shares any code with the original N64 release but may very likely have used the original N64 models for levels and areas; therefore it is not usually considered a \"version\" of  Super Mario 64 , but rather a rerelease. It has 150 stars instead of the original's 120, more powerups, different playable characters with different special abilities, and more.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Dire Dire Docks)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way. No Joystick Allowed The 100 coin star is currently used to reset Mario's ascent of steep slopes, which is useful near the top of the pyramid in  Shifting Sand Land  to collect the stars  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  and  Pyramid Puzzle .

This star is collected in both  70 Star  and  120 Star . Tips for grabbing Toad stars On the Japanese version of the game only, you can use Toad's vest becoming visible as a visual cue for when you are able to talk to him. On the U.S. version of the game, you are able to talk to Toad one frame sooner than on the Japanese version. Lag Reduction Strategies Optimal Lag Reduction After finishing THI, switch into Mariocam C-Down after Mario hits the ground. Spam C-Right as much as possible during the longjump to Toad, and make sure to talk to him from the front, rather than the left or right. This should allow the camera to align as shown in the video below. If the camera isn't aligned properly after the star spawns, you can press C-Right again to correct it. After collecting the star, hold an angle slightly to the left of your down notch, then do a buffered kick and longjump into the painting. Load video YouTube YouTube might collect personal data.

{"prompt": "Explain Glitchy Ledge Grab", "completion": "  GLG at  SA  Entrance A  glitchy ledge grab  or  GLG  is a kind of  ledge grab  that goes higher than a normal ledge grab. While a regular ledge grab can only allow Mario to ascend up to 150 units, a glitchy ledge grab allows Mario to ascend up to 238 units. This can allow Mario to reach areas he could not normally, particularly in the context of challenges such as the  A Button Challenge . Details If Mario is moving in the air with non-positive vertical speed, the game checks whether Mario can grab a ledge with two conditions. First, the game checks a 50 unit radius around Mario's position to see if there is a wall 30 units above Mario's position and no wall 150 units above Mario's position. Then, the game checks if there is a ledge Mario can grab on by looking at his x and z coordinates before being displaced by the wall and his y coordinate plus 160 units, looking for the highest floor below those coordinates, and checking whether that floor is at least 100 units above Mario.  [1] . Additionally, when the game looks for a floor, it includes a 78 unit buffer giving the floor search an effective height of 238 units. A glitchy ledge grab occurs when those two conditions are satisfied in unusual ways, so Mario is able to grab a ledge he normally wouldn't be able to. A GLG can be triggered in a few ways: The wall is slightly tilted, so Mario's lower point is within range of it but not his upper point, which triggers a ledge grab check when there is not supposed to be one (used in the  A Button Challenge  to enter  The Secret Aquarium  0xA)  [2] Mario's lower point is near a wall, but it detects the wrong floor because of a difference in the orientation of the wall hitbox and the direction the game uses to find the x,z position the floor is searched in (used in the  A Button Challenge  to go to  Bowser in the Sky  0xA)  [3] Mario's lower point touches a wall that ends as intended, but it detects the wrong floor because the floor search starts 238 units above Mario, which is high enough to find an unintended floor. Mario's lower point is near a wall, and his upper point is aligned exactly with a gap in the wall due to float imprecision.

{"prompt": "Explain Fish spawner", "completion": "In  Whomp's Fortress , a level editor shows that an unused object can be seen next to the cannon that appears to do nothing.

In the final game, the game does a 1/256 roll every time Mario makes a splash to see if a fish splashes along with the puddle. In the Shoshinkai 1995 Mario 64 footage, the same can be seen at the exact spot of the unused object. The exact reason for the change is unknown, but it is likely that the change was made because having an easter egg associated with an object meant an object slot was taken up, where as a simple 1/256 roll removed the need for these objects  [1] The object highlighted in yellow is a stubbed out useless object.

{"prompt": "Explain Bowser Bomb", "completion": "Bowser Bomb Technical Constants Object Group General Actor Actor Group Group 12 Draw Distance 7000 Hitbox Damage 3 Health 4 Radius 40 Height 40 Down Offset 40 Bowser Bombs  are the explosives surrounding the arenas in each  Bowser  fight. They are used to defeat Bowser. Behavior If Mario collides with the bomb, a regular explosion is spawned and then the bomb is deactivated. If Bowser collides with the bomb, a special explosion is spawned and the camera shakes. For 28 frames, the explosion spawned is scaled at a rate of (t/14)*9+1, where t is the number of frames after the explosion spawns. Every four frames, including the first frame, a puff of smoke is spawned until 20 frames have passed, resulting in five smoke puffs being spawned. The puffs are spawned with randomized z and x-positions and a randomized y-velocity relative the bomb's original position. Specifically, the x-position and z-position are randomly set from -400 to 200 units relative to the original position and the y-velocity can be from 0 to 10. Similarly to the explosion, for 28 frames each smoke puff spawned is scaled at a rate of (t/14)*9+1, where t is the number of frames after the smoke spawns. The puff's y-position increases according to its velocity each frame and its opacity is decreased by 10 each frame until it reaches 0. After 28 frames, the smoke is deactivated. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Objects Enemies Regular Amp  \u2022  Bob-omb  \u2022  Boo  \u2022  Bookend  \u2022  Bomp  \u2022  Bub   \u2022  Bubba  \u2022  Bullet Bill  \u2022  Bully  \u2022  Chain Chomp  \u2022  Chuckya  \u2022  Fly Guy  \u2022  Goomba  \u2022  Grindel  \u2022  Haunted Chair  \u2022  Heave-Ho  \u2022  Klepto  \u2022  Koopa  \u2022  Lakitu  \u2022  Mad Piano  \u2022  Moneybag  \u2022  Monty Mole  \u2022  Mr. Blizzard  \u2022  Mr. I  \u2022  Piranha Plant  \u2022  Fire Piranha Plant  \u2022  Pokey  \u2022  Scuttlebug  \u2022  Skeeter  \u2022  Snufit  \u2022  Spindel  \u2022  Spindrift  \u2022  Spiny  \u2022  Sushi  \u2022  Swoop  \u2022  Thwomp  \u2022  Tox Box  \u2022  Unagi  \u2022  Whomp Bosses King Bob-omb  \u2022   Big Boo  \u2022   Big Bully  \u2022  Bowser  \u2022  Eyerok  \u2022  Manta Ray  \u2022  Whomp King  \u2022  Wiggler NPCs Bob-omb Buddy  \u2022  Koopa the Quick  \u2022  Penguin  \u2022  Hoot  \u2022  MIPS  \u2022  Toad  \u2022  Ukiki  \u2022  Yoshi Other Objects Common Yellow Coin  \u2022  Blue Coin  \u2022  Red Coin  \u2022  1-Up Mushroom  \u2022  Bowling Ball  \u2022  Cannon  \u2022  Power Star  \u2022  Seesaw platforms  \u2022  Wing Cap  \u2022  Vanish Cap  \u2022  Metal Cap  \u2022  Elevator  \u2022  Sign  \u2022  Wooden post  \u2022  Cork Box  \u2022  Crazy Box  \u2022  Teleporter  \u2022  Warp Pipe  \u2022  Secret Level Specific Big Boo's Haunt tilting platform  \u2022  Merry-Go-Round  \u2022  Treadmill  \u2022  Pendulum  \u2022  Spinner  \u2022  Bowser Bomb  \u2022  Bowser key  \u2022  Grand Star  \u2022  Lethal Lava Land Drawbridge  \u2022  Tilted Inverted Pyramid Platform  \u2022  BitDW Trapdoor  \u2022  Controllable Platform  \u2022  Boulder Unused Boo key  \u2022  Bowser Anchor  \u2022  Fish spawner  \u2022  Trampoline  \u2022"}

Entering Hazy Maze Cave  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/uDtInisrqqM   The platform leading to the course is 205 units above the lowest floor [1] . The only known way to enter the course without pressing A is by using a  Star Dance Clip  using the star awarded by catching MIPS since Mario can grab onto ledges during his star dance animation. This maneuver can only be done twice as MIPS only appears twice throughout the game (when Mario has 15 stars for the first time and 50 stars for the second time), and will not reappear afterwards. MIPS will still respawn normally as long as its star is not collected. It should be noted that MIPS used to be required to drain the moat to access  Vanish Cap Under the Moat , which can now be done faster without MIPS by exploiting the misalignments at one corner of each pillar. Unlike ground pounding the pillars with MIPS, which uses only the object (MIPS) and not the star, grabbing the ledge leading to HMC requires MIPS to be present and Mario collecting its star. Swimming Beast in the Cavern  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/kd5TgsxVT7Y   Conveniently, there is a well-known glitch that allows Mario to clip through the elevator by standing at a certain black spot on the wall. When the elevator descends from above, the object collision will cause Mario to go past the wall and fall into the underground cavern, heading towards the island where the star is located.  Elevate for 8 Red Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/lT3SnMMLY0w   Jumping off a pole requires an A press, as it is the only way to get to the nearby platform without external help. In the past, Pannenkoek collected the star in 0.5 A presses [2]  by utilizing high negative speed to traverse the course and land on the moving platform necessary to reach the red coins located on higher platforms. An A press was held until this point in order to conserve speed up the elevator. In order to build such speed (more than 1500), Pannenkoek started  Hyperspeed Walking  (HSW) using the ceiling under the gate to keep him in place, navigated to the upper part of the course, and then bounced on a prepositioned scuttlebug to cross a large gap to clip into the red coins room.  Later in 2015, an improvement was made to reduce the A press count to 0 by  Scuttlebug Raising , and the TAS run was completed on June 26, 2016. A polished run with visual explanations was uploaded on February 25, 2018.  Mario first transported two scuttlebugs to the big gap leading to the left door and entered the red coins room on the right. Next, he transported the scuttlebug in that room close to the door Mario came from for raising. Then, he went back to the big gap and bounced on the two scuttlebugs he set up previously. Once he returns to the starting area, he heads towards the red coins room and begins raising the scuttlebug near the door. The repetitive segment takes 56 minutes to complete. Finally, Mario enters the room, grabs the pole, and patiently waits for the raised scuttlebug to drop down, pushing Mario to the nearby platform. Mario runs to the moving platform and begins completing all eight red coins to complete the mission. To reach the star (which is 300 units high [3] ), Mario bounces on a nearby scuttlebug. In December 2022, a new optimization was released for this star, saving roughly 55min. This is achieved by raising the scuttle inside the mesh wall in a way that it can drop under Mario on the pole. [4] Metal-Head Mario can Move!  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/69NMgKGFKC0   Mario arrives at the underwater cavern, and he presses the switch with a metal cap to open the gate. To begin the setup of hyperspeed, Mario enters the hallway to let the scuttlebug spawn for Mario and angle it away from the door; this is done to avoid the scuttlebug jumping when it sees Mario entering with super speed when facing Mario, causing Mario's bounce to fail. Mario builds up a large amount of negative speed by  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  (HSWS) on the slippery slope of the island. In order to accumulate speed, Mario enters the slippery slope and keeps in a standing position by holding C^ and enters the water, and then he gets out of the water with  conserved speed  by pressing Z to enter the sliding state. This is done repeatedly until Mario obtains negative 496 speed, slow enough to slide on  Dorrie  for 3 frames to get a sitting position for punching, but still fast enough to clip through the wall. A faster strategy is then available once the HSW strategy is discovered, allowing Mario to build up the required speed much faster. As early as the strategy is known, it was not made into TAS until a documented it [5] . Navigating the Toxic Maze  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/b5zwE4ALeoI   Mario has to enter the toxic maze for the star. The hardest part is exiting the maze via the doors on higher platforms, without pressing A to jump. To avoid pressing A, Pannenkoek needs very good RNG to set the swoopers flying at desirable angles and bounce on three of them at the right moment. The reason such strategy can work is that swoopers fly in three different heights: low, middle, and high; this allows Mario to bounce on them in ascending order. Afterwards, Mario can ride the elevator and collect the star. A-Maze-Ing Emergency Exit  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/lwcGE7Js1QE   The two main difficulties are exiting the toxic maze and crossing the gap to the A-Maze-Ing Emergency Exit platform. In the past, Pannenkoek utilized Hyper Speed Walking again to collect the star in 0.5 A Presses [6]  until the scuttlebug raising technique is found. Mario transports the scuttlebug to a point close to the A-Maze-Ing Emergency Exit star and then exits the maze by bouncing on a Monty Mole and a flying swooper. Once Mario reaches the door leading to the star, the prepositioned scuttlebug is then being raised for 35 minutes. Finally, Mario manipulates it to lunge towards the midpoint, allowing him to bounce on it and clear the gap, landing on the platform. Mario then collects the star. Watch for Rolling Rocks  (0x) Main article:  Watch for Rolling Rocks Video\u00a0:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFx7woWkZbc   The main breakthrough for collecting this star 0xA was the discovery that it is possible to clip the  controllable platform  in the red coin rooms out of bounds. The trick was named  Mario's Platform Adventure , and it allowed the transport of enemies beyond their default room. This allows Mario to enter a hallway with swoopers and guide them to the nearby elevator to raise their heights and clip them through the wall onto the controllable platform. They are then brought to the room with the star and clipped back in bounds. A scuttlebug is raised up to the platform, and another swooper is lured over to the platform as well. Finally, Mario uses  Vertical Speed Conservation , bounces on all three swoopers and the scuttlebug, and performs a  Glitchy Ledge Grab  to reach the platform. [7] HMC 100 coins  (0x) Video 1 (main strategy):  https://youtu.be/oqji_Lr1lFc   Video 2 (alternate, faster strat):  https://youtu.be/-F61DW6eFHo   Multiple techniques are required to get 100 coins in Hazy Maze Cave, as resources are limited. Using good maneuvering, Mario dives onto a high platform to kill a Mr. I and then proceeds to the underwater cavern by clipping through a wall. Mario then collects most of the coins there before returning to the upper part of the course using the elevator and enter the toxic maze. The major breakthrough (in the first video) is finding a way to ground pound the blue coin switch without A presses. Mario manipulates RNG for the four swoopers to fly in the desired path. Mario then does a first frame landing of a dive recover onto the blue coin and punches towards the edge of the platform. At the right moment, Mario reactivates the stored vertical speed (with  VSC ) by punching off the platform, and bounces on two swoopers to ground pound the block. After collecting the blue coins close to the ground (and not the topmost blue coin), Mario then waits for the other two swoopers and a snuffit to line up so that he can leave the maze by bouncing on them, collecting the coins on the exit platform, and then return to the maze to collect the enemy coins. Mario then collects the 100 coin star in the maze. Later in 2015 (in the second video), Pannenkoek found a way to collect the topmost blue coin by bouncing on the third swooper. The primary obstacle is that there are very few swooper paths that do this since the swooper needs to stay close to Mario when the VSC to ground-pound movement is performed. Additionally, the said swooper must head towards the blue coin when the switch's effect is active. Altogether, it takes a lot of effort to find a swooper path that satisfies all of the above. With 99 coins, Mario uses a Monty Mole and the fourth swooper to simultaneously land on the exit platform and collect the swooper's coin, spawning the 100 coin star. With this strategy, Mario can collect the star at the exit of the toxic maze, instead of having to collect the 100 coin star within the maze with no way out, forcing him to exit the course by dying and then reenter it. Other challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge , with  Metal-Head Mario Can Move!  requiring falling onto the purple switch with enough speed to press it without the  Metal Cap . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected.  Swimming Beast in the Cavern  is almost possible, with only the small lip of the elevator preventing Mario from getting onto it. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected, as they all require entering doors. In the  Pacifist Challenge , every star except for  100 Coins  can be collected, because there are not enough coins to collect without killing enemies. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected.  Metal-head Mario Can Move!  requires a BLJ to bypass the gate, and  Navigating the Toxic Maze  requires precise wall kicks to bypass the elevator. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to get more coins than intended.

Keep in mind that if there are any blue stars (uncollected) present in the star selection menu, then the last version that can be selected is the first blue star and not the stars after it: Act 1: Klepto : Accessed by selecting Star 1. Klepto holds a star. Act 2: No Tornadoes : Accessed by selecting Star 2 or Star 3, but only after completing  In the Talons of the Big Bird . Klepto does not hold a star, while there are no extra tornadoes in the course. Act 3: Tornadoes : Accessed by selecting Star 4 through Star 6. Extra tornadoes will appear in certain quicksand areas. Tips Star order may vary depending on preferences. What's important to know is that it's preferable to select stars 2 or 3 for 100 coin to avoid the tornadoes.

{"prompt": "Explain Hyperspeed Punching", "completion": "Hyperspeed Punching  (abbreviated as  HSP ) is a technique that allows speed to be built by repeatedly move-punching on a slope within a specific angle range. Given ideal geometry, it is possible to gain arbitrary speed in this manner. Like  Hyper Speed Walking , this is a method for obtaining PU speed that can be performed in zero A presses, making it potentially useful for the  A Button Challenge . While move-punching, Mario has abnormally low friction compared to other actions with similar physics. If the floor is steep enough, Mario can overpower this friction with downhill slope acceleration. Unless Mario is standing in shallow water, the floor must not be too steep or else he will begin to slide. To execute this technique, Mario needs to begin his next punch on the same frame that he ends his last. Joystick input must have low enough magnitude to avoid diving, but otherwise doesn't matter. Conditions In order for Mario to gain net positive acceleration, the  normal.y  value of the floor must be contained in a specific range, depending on the floor's  slope class [1] : 0x13 (slide):  0.9848077 - 0.9961947 0x14 (slippery):  0.9396926 - 0.9848077 0x15 (non-slippery): Impossible def (default):  0.7880108 - 0.808690 These ranges apply when Mario is not standing in shallow water. Standing in shallow water prevents Mario from sliding, allowing HSP to be performed on steeper slopes. Specifically, there is no minimum slope steepness in shallow water. In slide areas, namely  Princess's Secret Slide  and  Tall, Tall Mountain 's slide, HSP is not possible without shallow water. Applications This strategy can be used in  Jolly Roger Bay  to build at least 150 speed on one of the pillars. The upper bound is a result of the speed lost from having to repeatedly conserve speed from water onto land. This strategy allows the following actions to be done in 0 A Presses: Landing on the  Blast to the Stone Pillar  platform (using 100 stored speed) [2] , although a slower method using  HSW  exists. Ground pounding the blue coin switch in  Jolly Roger Bay  with 128 stored speed to collect the 100 coin star without difficult goomba manipulation. Zero A press PU speed in  Shifting Sand Land , which was used for a console-viable  Secret Aquarium  entry [3] .

To complete it, Mario must travel up the level and climb up the moving platforms around the tower to reach the  Power Star  located at the top of the tower. The tower will replace King Whomp in every star except the first star.  Contents 1   A Button Challenge 1.1   Original Strategy 2   TAS History 2.1   TAS Strategy 3   References A Button Challenge The star can be done TAS in 0 A presses. The TAS WR does this star with the 100 coin star. The difficult part was getting onto the first tower platform, which was too high for an easy method. The original method of getting onto the bottom platform was rather complex. The reason for collecting the 100 coin star with this star is because a huge time save which involves getting on top of the bullet bill blaster requires a  star dance clip . Before entering the course, Mario uses the penguin in  CCM  to set a  HOLP . Mario begins by going around the course, collecting coins. Because the rotating bridge is in a bad position when Mario approaches it, the  coins  there can't be collected as it is too slow. Instead, Mario collects the  coin ring  above the  Shoot Into the Wild Blue  star and bounces down with a slide kick onto the  blue coin  block.  After reaching 99 coins, he dives from the rotating islands to the bottom of the course. This fall is just high enough to give him  large fall damage . While performing a  pause buffered hitstun , Mario throws a  cork box  remotely, utilizing the preset HOLP. In an ideal situation, Mario would be able to get on the elevator by using a misalignment, but the misalignment only appears on one elevator, which is unfortunately in the air at the time Mario arrives. This makes the situation very tricky as there is a limited amount of time before the coin despawns. When Mario reaches the top of the elevator, he heads to the bullet bill blaster, and creates a  100 coin star  from the Cork Box's  coins , and does a star dance clip onto the top. Mario  dive grinds  to build speed, and does a dive recover to get onto the tower platforms. From here, he climbs up the tower and collects the star. Original Strategy Mario first enters Bob Omb Battlefield, and constructs a goomba staircase off the side of the mountain in order to set a HOLP at a precise spot. Mario then enters Whomp's Fortress, and collects 99 coins. He then throws a cork box using the hat in hand glitch. The box is released mid air and it lands on the base of the tower. Mario then can spawn a 100 coin star in a specific spot. Mario takes a second cork box onto the top of the level. He then remotely releases it, and stores vertical speed on the elevator as it flips around. The box then pushes mario off, which activates his vertical speed, while at the same time giving Mario horizontal speed. Combined with a star dance clip, this is enough to bring mario to the top of the platform. From here, Mario can climb the tower and collect the star.

Mario began by heading up the ramp onto the bricks and triple jumping off the slope to reach the tower. A large portion of the tower can be skipped by side flipping and wall kicking directly onto the elevator platform. The sideflip evolved into a triple jump, getting onto the elevator platform in one jump without any ledge grab. Overtime, more movent optimisations were made.  The current strategy starts with mario performing a  Glitchy Wall Kick  to get onto the ramp. He then performs a jump dive and slides down the side of the ramp, and jumps to the brick ramp infront of him. He kicks to maintain speed and then jumps to the falling blocks and wall kicks to the top. Mario then does a triple jump, starting with a kick to maintain more speed, off of the first platform, followed by a wall kick to get directly onto the top of the tower.

{"prompt": "Explain Floor", "completion": "A  surface  or  triangle  in Super Mario 64 is a piece of geometry that exerts some kind of force or effect on Mario. Every triangle falls into one of three categories: a floor triangle, a wall triangle, or a ceiling triangle. However, a triangle does not store what category it is. Instead, its category is determined based on the y component of the triangle's  normal vector [1] . If y component > 0.01, then it is a floor. If y component < -0.01, then it is a ceiling. Otherwise, it is a wall. Contents 1   Walls 1.1   Hitbox 1.2   Non-vertical walls 2   Floors 2.1   Hitbox 3   Ceilings 4   Surface Types 5   References Walls A triangle is a wall triangle if and only if -0.01 < normal.y < 0.01. Hitbox   The hitbox of a wall during both the initial handle and a ground quarter step, simplified   The hitbox of a wall during an air quarter step, simplified   The hitbox of a wall in the water, including both the inital handle and the single frame movement, simplified All wall hitboxes are handled once per  frame  and once per  quarter step  of Mario's movement. Most of the time, a wall has two separate hitboxes handled one after the other within a frame or quarter step. A wall hitbox's initial frame handle has a hitbox extending 50  units  forward and 50 units backward, offset down 60, and then a hitbox extending 24 units in each direction offset down 30. A quarter step of ground movement has a hitbox extending 24  units  forward and 24 units backward, offset down 30, and then a hitbox extending 50 units in each direction offset down 60. This is the opposite order from the initial handle, but the outcome is the same. A quarter step of air movement gives the wall a hitbox of 50 units in each direction offset down 150, and then a hitbox of 50 units offset down 30. Water movement does not implement quarter steps. After one frame of water movement, a wall hitbox extends 110 units in each direction, offset down 10. Since both the water handle and the initial handle both happen once per frame, the hitboxes can be overlaid. Non-vertical walls   This wall in  BoB  is not quite vertical.  The majority of walls in the game are perfectly vertical, but not all. Walls that are not vertical are one cause of  Glitchy Ledge Grabs . Floors A floor triangle is a triangle with normal.y > 0.01. Hitbox A floor's hitbox extends 78 units below and 100 units above the floor triangle. This allows Mario to move vertically along floors; if he is moving up or down a slope or stairs, he will be off the floor after his horizontal motion but still in its hitbox, which will snap him to the floor. He will always be snapped up if he's in a floor's hitbox below the floor, but he'll only be snapped down while above a floor if he is in a ground movement state. When walking on a slope, Mario will move horizontally at a rate slower than his actual speed, known as his  De Facto Speed . Any location that is not inside or above a floor hitbox is considered out of bounds; Mario will not be able to move into it of his own volition, and if forced into it, he will die. Ceilings A ceiling hitbox extends from 160 units below the ceiling to infinitely above. For ground and air movement, the ceiling will try its best to keep Mario out of it. If Mario walks into the ceiling, his quarter step will be canceled, and he will remain in place and do the pushing animation. If Mario is moving upwards in the air when coming in contact with the ceiling, his quarter step will be canceled and his vertical speed will be set to 0. On the contrary, when Mario falls onto a ceiling while airborne, his quarter step will be canceled and his horizontal speed will get set to 0, making him fall straight down. Although a ceiling will extend upwards infinitely, a floor can overwrite the ceiling hitbox, meaning that its hitbox will stop right when the floor hitbox starts. On the American release of the game, there is an interesting ceiling example found in  Rainbow Ride , where  the top of the chimney is not capped off , making the ceiling go up forever, softlocking Mario if he ends up sliding into it. Even though ceilings try to push Mario outwards, they can still be accessed using various techniques, such as getting pushed by an enemy. Note that once Mario is standing inside the ceiling, he is no longer able to move anywhere due to his quarter steps being cancelled.  For Water movement, Mario instead gets warped downward by ceilings. These downwarps are used in various TASes and speedruns. Surface Types While the surface type of a surface is not restricted to only floors, walls, or ceilings, in practice they are only used in certain scenarios, or wouldn't have any affect if such surface was of a different type, i.e. there could be a vertical wind ceiling or a death barrier wall, but those surfaces would have the behaviour.

By touching any of the  crystal taps  in the course, the water level is raised or lowered to the height of the tap used. Additionally, Mario's height as he enters the painting determines the water level immediately after entering the course (low, medium, or high). The course has a tunnel with a loading zone to take Mario back and forth between the main area and \"downtown\". Contents 1   Tips 2   120 Route 3   120 Route (Beginner) 4   70 Route Tips The water level you get when entering the stage depends on the where you enter the painting; enter the bottom of the painting for the lowest water level, the middle for the medium water level, and toward the top for the highest water level. 120 Route Quick Race through Downtown!

Behavior Spindrift's behavior consists of two main actions. In its first action, Spindrift approaches its target forward velocity of 4 units/frame at a rate of 1 unit/frame per frame. If the distance from Spindrift\u2019s home to Mario is greater than 1000 units, Spindrift\u2019s target angle is set to face its home. If Spindrift\u2019s home is less than 1000 units from Mario but more than 300 units from Mario, Spindrift\u2019s target angle is set to face Mario. After its target angle is set, Spindrift rotates toward this angle a rate of 1024 units/frame (5.625 degrees/frame). Spindrift\u2019s second action occurs if Mario runs into Spindrift but does not kill it. In this action, Spindrift\u2019s forward velocity is set to -10 units/frame, and then after 20 frames its action is reset to its first action.

While in  quicksand , if Mario attempts to enter the  double jump  or  twirling  actions he will single jump instead. Doing this with twirling is very complicated and requires the use of the  air throw landing  action [1] . Contents 1   Transition In 2   Airborne cancels 3   Behavior 4   References Transition In Note: All airborne actions refer to (reference   [2] ) for the \"Transition In\". As with all actions, Transition In happens before common cancels and behavior. Generally, when transitioning into the jump action... (This is shared with the  hold jump  action) Mario's current animation is stopped.  Specifically, an animation flag is updated:  m->marioObj->header.gfx.animInfo.animID = -1; Mario's vertical speed is set to 42 + a quarter of the current forward speed. If Mario is squished and/or has a quicksand depth more than 1, the vertical speed is halved. Mario's forward speed is multiplied by 0.8. Then, more general things occur. These happen to all airborne actions. [3]  Steps 3 and after apply to all actions. [4] Mario's peak height is updated. Mario's [UNKNOWN_08] flag is set. Mario's voice clip played flag is reset. Another flag [UNKNOWN_18] is reset as long as the action doesn't have the Air flag. The previous action is set to the current action (which is not yet the jump action). The current action is set to the jump action. The action argument is set. The action state is set to 0. The action timer is set to 0. Airborne cancels A variety of \"cancels\" are checked prior to actually performing any airborne action. These are as follows: [5] If Mario's height is lower than 100 units below the water height:  Water Plunge  (see  Idle#Stationary cancels ) If Mario is supposed to be squished, mario_stop_riding_and_holding,  Squished If Mario is above vertical wind (and the action allows vertical wind), then  Vertical Wind Set quicksand depth to 0 If (Mario's action is not (flag)invulnerable, twirling, or flying, (and the flag MARIO_UNKNOWN_18 is not there))  and  Mario has fallen more than 1150 units from his peak, play SOUND_MARIO_WAAAOOOW and add the MARIO_UNKNOWN_18 flag Behavior Certain things here are more explained on their individual pages. If something lacks detail, check the link for more information. As with all airborne actions, a variety of \"cancels\" are checked prior to actually performing the jump action. (See above section  #Airborne cancels ) Then, the following happens: If the B button is pressed, Mario will either enter the  dive  action if his speed is greater than 28 or the  jump kick  action otherwise. This stops the jump action. If the Z button is pressed, Mario will enter the  ground pound  action. This stops the jump action. Mario performs the other noises for the jump. Now, Mario performs the quarter-frame movement via a full  common air step . The landing action is a  jump land  action and the check has both the \"Check Ledge Grab\" and \"Check Hang\" flags.

In order to trigger Bowser's text after defeating him, Mario must be within a short distance of him and face towards the center of his body. The \"whoosh\" sound that plays while spinning Bowser is not indicative of whether he is pointing towards a bomb; try to focus on aiming  visually . It is highly recommended that runners who play using an original Nintendo 64 controller switch to a different controller for Bowser fights, as rapidly spinning the N64 controller's stick will wear it down. Recommended controllers include a Hori Mini Pad, a  Retro-Bit Tribute 64  or  Warrior64 , or a GameCube controller via a  Raphnet adapter .

{"prompt": "Explain Vertical Speed Conservation", "completion": "Vertical Speed Conservation  ( VSC ) is a technique that takes advantage of the fact that certain actions do not reset Mario\u2019s vertical speed to 0 when landing. Furthermore, there are a few ground actions that also have this property. If Mario can then leave the ground without overwriting the stored vertical speed, he can effectively reactivate his speed gained prior to landing. [1] Contents 1   Timeline of a VSC 1.1   Preserving vertical speed upon landing 1.2   Maintaining vertical speed on the ground 1.3   Reactivating vertical speed 2   Applications 2.1   Ascending platforms 3   Variations 4   References Timeline of a VSC There are three parts to a VSC: When the speed is preserved upon landing, when the speed is maintained on the ground, and when the speed is reactivated in the air. If a positive vertical speed is stored properly, Mario can gain precious height while being in a freefall state, allowing Mario to grab onto ledges where a  dive recover  cannot, or using the  misalignment  of a corner to ground pound onto the floor.  Preserving vertical speed upon landing The Vertical speed is in effect only when Mario is in the air. Thus, the vertical speed does not have any effects during his ground movement. Usually, the speed will be reset to 0 when Mario lands, but there are cases when it is not. These actions include: Landing from a dive recover (most common) Landing from a ground pound Landing from a slide kick bounce Landing from a lava boost Landing from a twirl Landing from a dive with an object held Landing after throwing an object in the air Entering the first person mode on the frame Mario lands (Also called C-Up (C^) VSC) Landing immediately when the in-game text starts Landing when a cutscene begins (where Mario is unable to move, such as the Chain Chomp cutscene) Landing after collecting a star and exiting the course Maintaining vertical speed on the ground Many actions will reset Mario's vertical speed to zero when moving on the ground, such as walking, running, and crawling. Jumping will override the preserved value with a new one depending on what type of jump Mario is performing. However, the following actions do not affect Mario's vertical speed: Punching (by pressing B) and punch-kick combo, as long as there is no contact with an enemy or wall Crouching (by pressing Z), staying in place Breakdancing (by pressing B while crouching), as long as there is no contact with an enemy or wall Grabbing an object Dropping an object Throwing an object Remaining stationary Punching off of a moving platform as it moves under Mario Reactivating vertical speed There are many ways to leave the ground to reactivate the vertical speed. Mario obviously should not jump since a new vertical speed value will be used in its place. Actions that allow speed reactivation includes: Having the floor below Mario disappear (or become intangible) Having the floor move out from under Mario (and he does not move with it) Pushing Mario out of a platform with a wall or an object collision Standing on an edge of certain moving platforms to fall off due to  float -to-short imprecision Having Mario move off the floor under him (by punching towards an edge of a platform, or a floor gap), and he can snap onto floors 78 units higher and down to floors 100 units lower to avoid getting off the ground Applications In an  A Button Challenge , as Mario cannot press A to jump, storing vertical speed is most commonly done by performing a dive recover. A dive recover has an initial vertical speed of 30 that decreases by 4 on each frame, resulting in a maximum of 26 vertical speed that can be stored if Mario lands on the first frame of a dive recover. This is called a VSC26 (having 26 vertical speed conserved). It is positive vertical speed that gets used more often, since it is more desirable for Mario to be moving upwards, but it a lot more difficult. Additionally, Mario cannot encounter a ceiling, which would cancel his movement and reset his vertical speed to zero. Nevertheless, Mario can land with positive vertical speed stored by dive recovering on the following: On a steep slope, facing uphill with high horizontal speed On a different, higher platform whose height is at least 7.5 units apart On a rising platform As a VSC26 is a dive recover with the first frame chopped off, he can gain only 98 units high, as opposed to 128 units high from a dive recover. However, being in a freefall state allows Mario to grab on ledges and ground pound to gain height. Still, there are strict limitations on how much speed Mario can store and how it can be reactivated. Ascending platforms Maximum height reachable Dive Recover 26 VSC Edge 156 247 (ledge grab) Corner  (misalignement) 206 274 (ground pound) SDC 298 (ledge) 345 (ground pound) The maximum height of a platform a dive recover can ascend onto is 156 units up when using a normal edge, and ~206 units when using a misalignment. In comparison, a VSC26 can ascend onto a platform 247 units high with a ledge grab, and 274 units using a ground pound into a misalignment. Furthermore, if a star is involved, the combination of a dive recover and a  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) can reach 298 units up, while the combination of ground pounding and SDC allows Mario to get onto a floor 345 units up. Examples of this action are as follows: A Button Challenge Grabbing the edge of the second floor in  Big Boo's Haunt  using the ascending stairs, effectively saving 5 A presses for 120 star run as this action is required for 5 of the main mission stars. In  Bowser in the Dark World , storing VSC26 using glitchy collision check of a crystal and punching towards a platform to ledge-grab, effectively saving an otherwise mandatory A press. In  Hazy Maze Cave , storing 18 vertical speed using the Blue Coin Switch and Ground-pounding on it with the help of two swoopers, allowing access to collecting 100 coins in the course Grabbing a star in  Tick Tock Clock  using a 1-unit floor gap to pop up with VSC, speed being gained by the edge of a conveyor belt Grabbing onto the platform where to pole is located in  Tick Tock Clock , first collecting a coin by a bob-omb on an ascending platform with VSC26 to spawn the 100-coin star as high as possible, and then use VSC26 ground pounding near an edge with Star Dance Clip, removing one of the A presses required to reach the pole. Dive Recovering onto a rising elevator in  Whomp's Fortress , using a cork box released from the  HOLP  to reactivate VSC26 and land on the platform via Star Dance Clip. Landing on the platform leading to the floating ship in  Rainbow Ride , using VSC26 and Lakitu Bounce on falling donut blocks An alternative method of ground pounding the post to free the chain chomp in  Bob-omb Battlefield , without cloning or using the shell An alternative method of ground pounding on King Whomp in  Whomp's Fortress , using the misalignment of King Whomp and storing VS2 to reactivate it with the edge An alternative method of getting to the platform with a spinning heart in the volcano of  Lethal Lava Land , using the first-frame landing of lava boost onto a moving platform and activate VSC80 with a dive (slower than the current method of lava boosting on a lavafall) Non-A Button Challenge Collecting the 5th secret of  Mario Wings to the Sky  using VSC330 by jumping and landing the first frame with 914 horizontal speed, converting into 334 vertical speed with a double jump, and then being pushed off by a Bob-omb to reactivate vertical speed. Mario enters a freefall state holding a fake cork box to clone the top coin prematurely, effectively removing it and collecting the secret using narrow region of the hitbox where it is not overlapped by the center coin. Variations Vertical and Horizontal Speed Conservation  ( VHSC ), conserving both horizontal speed and vertical speed at once, occurs when Mario lands on the platform and immediately falls off on the next frame, putting Mario at a falling state but with horizontal speed intact. It can be achieved by having the floor under Mario disappear or move out, which float-to-short imprecisions can also cause.

{"prompt": "Explain Infinite coin glitches", "completion": "Infinite Coin Glitches  are a category of glitches that allow Mario to collect infinite coins. Contents 1   Coin Cloning 2   Moneybag Duplication 2.1   Rapid Moneybag Duplication 3   Breaking-Disappearing Cork Box 4   Piranha Plant Glitch 5   Timestop 6   Ride Cancelling 7   References Coin Cloning Main article:  Cloning By grabbing an  object  as it  unloads , Mario can hold a fake object. A coin may load into the fake object's slot and Mario can then hold the coin. If the coin comes from a coin spawner, Mario can load the coin again by leaving and re-entering the coin spawner's radius, which would theoretically lead to infinite coins; however, each clone takes up an object slot, so unless a method of resetting the level such as a loading zone or sub-area is available, only a finite number of coins can be cloned before the object limit is reached and the game crashes. Moneybag Duplication Moneybag  duplication is a glitch which causes a Moneybag to duplicate itself into two Moneybags. By waking it up on the same frame it goes to sleep, you can cause it to create an awake one as well as an asleep one. Since these are technically separate objects, there are now two moneybags. Moneybag duplication can be used to get infinite coins in  Snowman's Land . In the  ABZ Challenge , extra moneybags are useful for some stars in  Snowman's Land  because you can bounce on them to get extra height. Rapid Moneybag Duplication This is a trick to duplicate the Moneybag rapidly. [1]  This was found by Tyler Kehne. The Moneybag will duplicate if Mario enters within 800 units of its home on the same frame that the Moneybag enters within 100 units of its home. So by oscillating in and out of this 800 unit radius, we can duplicate a new Moneybag every 2 frames. This technique should lead to faster SL 100 coin star times. One caveat though is that there is a 1/50 chance that the Moneybag's home will instantly translate 200 units to the side when awakening it, meaning that there's a 1/50 chance that the rapid duplication could come to an abrupt end. When going for a WR time, we'd need to get a better RNG sequence so that we could continue duplicating without this issue. Breaking-Disappearing Cork Box Main article:  Breaking-Disappearing Cork Box Glitch The breaking-disappearing cork box glitch is caused by breaking a  cork box  right when it disappears. This way it will respawn, but will also give three coins from breaking. The easiest way to do the glitch is to place the cork box on top of an object that becomes intangible when Mario moves away, and then returning to make the object tangible right when the box disappears. This method of infinite coins does not take up object slots, and so it can be used to create more coins than cloning would. Infinite coins via cloning would eventually crash the game. It is also possible to do this glitch while also grabbing the  cork box fake  by having the box break by touching the wall of a moving object. Piranha Plant Glitch The large  Piranha Plants  in  Tiny-Huge Island  can be used to collect infinite coins. By attacking the Piranha Plant on the last frame of it being out of the ground, then defeating it once it comes back up, reloading the area will make it reappear. This can be repeated indefinitely, but it is only possible in Tiny-Huge Island. Timestop Main article:  Timestop This method is only possible on the Japanese version of the game. It requires the player to be able to move around while most of the level is frozen because of a textbox. This is achievable in multiple ways, such as jumping at the same time as a proximity-based textbox is activated. In this state, coins can be collected but do not unload until time is resumed. The player can exploit this by stopping time, collecting a coin, and entering a warp zone. This means that the coin is collected but doesn't unload, so you can return to the area with the coin and repeat. Ride Cancelling Main article:  Ride Cancelling When Mario gets off of a shell, the game sends a \"signal\" that the shell uses to decide that it should unload. The \"getting off a shell\" signal overrides other signals, so if the player gets off a shell at the same time as collecting a coin, but the stop riding signal will prevent the coin from actually unloading. This process can be repeated by using a cloned shell, which allows for the shell to be reused multiple times.

{"prompt": "Explain Quarter Frames", "completion": "Typically, Mario's position is updated incrementally using his velocity. These increments are called  steps , and they behave differently when Mario is on the ground, in the air, in water, hanging, and climbing a pole. When on the ground or in the air, these steps typically occur four times per frame, and are commonly referred to as  quarter steps  or colloquially  quarter frames . Steps are also responsible for detecting collision with  surfaces , updating Mario's  referenced surfaces , and updating Mario's  water level . However, quarter steps don't detect object collisions or warps.

Return GROUND_STEP_NONE. Also see  Idle#stationary ground step Air Step Certain things here are more explained on their individual pages. If something lacks detail, check the link for more information. When an action performs a  common  air step, the first thing Mario does is update his horizontal velocity/sideways position via  straining . This is only for the common air step and is not part of the quarter-frame checks. Quarter-Frame Checks After that is updated, the movement is split into \"quarter-steps\" that breakdown Mario's movement and determine what his outcome of each step is. The checks for the quarter-steps are as follows: The position a quarter of Mario's velocity ahead of Mario is checked for cancels/outcomes. Anything in bold is an exit out of the rest of the checks. If the position is above OOB but below Mario's current floor height, Mario's height is changed to the floor height and he  lands . If the position is above OOB but not below Mario's current floor height, Mario's height is set to the new height and he  hits a wall . If the action has the  \"riding shell\" flag  and the water level at the position is above the position's floor (up to 78 units above the position): The floor height from here on is the water height. The floor from this point on is a \"fake\" floor on the surface of the water. The floor's origin offset is set to the water height. If the position's height is 78 units or less below a floor and there is not a ceiling 160 units or less above it (because of how variable types an  overflow jump  may occur here): Mario's position horizontally is updated to the new position. Mario's height is set to that of the floor's height. Mario's floor and floor height are updated. Mario  lands . If the position's height is 78 units or less below a floor and there is a ceiling 160 units or less above it (because of how variable types an  overflow jump  may occur here): Mario's height is set to that of the floor's height. Mario  lands . (Because Mario's floor is not updated, this is where a  pedro spot  may occur) If the position's height is 160 units under, at, or above a ceiling and his vertical velocity is positive or zero: Mario's vertical velocity is set to zero. If the ceiling above Mario is hangable and the air step has the  \"check hang\" flag , Mario  hangs . (Since this did not use the new position's ceiling/location, this is potentially a  hangable-ceiling upwarp. ) Otherwise,  nothing happens . If the position's height is 160 units under, at, or above a ceiling and his vertical velocity is negative: If the position's height is at or below Mario's floor height, Mario's height is set to the floor height, and he  lands . Otherwise, Mario's height is set to the new height and he  hits a wall . If there is a wall 30 units above the position but not 150 units above the position and the air step has the  \"check ledge grab\" flag : If Mario's velocity is positive, Mario is pushed by the wall opposite the velocity direction, and there is a floor 60 units behind the wall within 238 units upward, Mario  ledge grabs . (Potentially a  GLG ) Otherwise Mario's position is set to the new position, his floor and floor height are updated, and  nothing happens . Mario's position is set to the new position and his floor and floor height are updated. If Mario is colliding with a wall 150 or 30 units up and the upper or only wall is lava, he  lava wall boosts . If Mario is colliding with a wall 150 or 30 units up and Mario is facing perpendicular to 0x6000 units away, he  hits a wall . If no other exit has occurred,  nothing happens . This repeats until Mario encounters something besides  nothing happens , up to four times including the initial time. Mario tracks his \"exit\", with  nothing happens  being tracked if the whole process completed four times. Perform Air Step Set Mario's wall to null (this is a loop) Do 4 times: Let the next intended position be Mario's position plus velocity/4 Perform an air quarter step, where \"new position\" means \"next intended position\" btw, as shown above If nothing happens, continue loop, else exit loop Let stepResult be the result of the last air quarter step performed If Mario's y velocity is positive, set peak height to Mario's y position (the peak height field is used for things like fall damage) Mario's step noise is updated based on his floor. If Mario is not flying,  gravity  is applied. Vertical wind  is now applied/accounted for. Mario's visual position is updated to Mario's position. Mario's yaw is updated to match the in-game angle. Return stepResult Common Air Step Results If doing a common air step, Mario now decides what to do based off the \"exit\" from Perform Air Step. Here is what he does for each exit: Nothing Happens : Mario's animation is now applied. Lands : If Mario is not over a hard  surface , the  terrain  is either snow or desert, Mario's peak height is more than 1000 units above him, the surface does not belong to an object, and the Y normal of the surface is not less than .8660254 (square root of 3 divided by 2): Mario plays an OOF noise, dependent on which  version of the game . Mario spawns particles. Mario's action is set to the  feet stuck in ground  action and the  lands  checks stop. If Mario's action is not twirling, the floor is not lava, his negative velocity is less than -55, and the distance from the peak height to Mario is more than 3000 units: Mario is hurt by 16 (24 without his hat). The camera shakes. Mario plays the \"attacked\" noise. Mario is set to the  hard backward ground knockback  action and the  lands  checks stop. If Mario's action is not twirling, the floor is not lava, his negative velocity is less than -55, and the distance from the peak height to Mario is more than 1150 units: Mario is hurt by 8 (12 without his hat). Mario is squished for 30. The camera shakes. Mario plays the \"attacked\" noise. Mario is set to his action's landing action. Hits a Wall : Mario's animation is now applied. If Mario's forward velocity is more than 16 and is in contact with a physical wall/surface: Mario's yaw is \"reflected\" across the most recent wall Mario collided with, up to the first 4 walls. (This can be glitchy with more than 1 wall, i.e.  unreferenced walls ). Mario plays a noise depending on whether or not he is wearing a metal cap. If Mario's forward velocity is more than 16 and he is not in contact with a physical wall/surface (i.e. OOB): A different sound is played, but Mario's yaw is not reflected. If Mario is in contact with a wall, his action is set to the  air hit wall  action. If Mario is not in contact with a wall (i.e. hitting OOB): Any positive vertical speed is capped to 0. If Mario's forward velocity is 38 or more, spawn particles and set his action to the  backward air knockback  action. If Mario's forward velocity is more than 8 but less than 38, set Mario's forward speed to -8 and set his action to the  soft bonk  action. If Mario's forward velocity is 16 or less (initially, not after these other changes), set the forward velocity to 0. Ledge Grabs Mario's animation is set the idle ledge grab animation. Mario enters the  ledge grab  action while dropping any held objects and no longer riding a shell. Hangs Mario's action is set to the  start hanging  action. Lava Wall Boosts Mario's yaw is set perpendicular to the wall. Mario's forward speed is capped to 24. If Mario is not wearing a metal cap, he is hurt 12 (or 18 without his hat). Mario plays the noise for being burned. The camera preset is set to the area's default preset. Mario enters the  lava boost  action while dropping any held objects and no longer riding a shell. Common Air Knockback Step Similar to Common Air Step, it uses the \"exit\" from Perform Air Step. This function takes in a  landing action , a  hard fall action , and a  speed . Before calling Perform Air Step, it sets Mario's speed to  speed . Common Air Knockback Step can cancel into  Feet Stuck In Ground ,  landing action , and  hard fall action . Mario cannot  Hang  or  Ledge Grab .  Nothing Happens  and  Lava Wall Boosts  (contains cancel  Lava Boost ) are the same as for Perform Air Step. Lands If should get stuck in ground, drop and set action to  Feet Stuck In Ground If y-velocity less than negative 55 and floor is not lava, If fell more than 3000 units, shake camera, play MARIO_SOUND_ATTACKED, and drop and set mario action to the  hard fall action  with argument 4 Else if fell more than 1500 units and floor is not slippery Hurt counter += 8 if cap, else 12 Squish counter += 30 If neither of the first two checks canceled, set action to  landing action  (not changing the action argument, though there are differences in the Japanese version where the  Thrown Forward  and  Thrown Backward  intermediate actions cause the landing action argument to be hurtCounter) Hits a wall Change to the background air kb Animation If Mario's wall is not null Mario's facingAngle[1] = wallAngle - (s32)(facingAngle[1] - wallAngle) basically this step added two wallAngle play either METAL_BONK or BONK sound else play HIT sound facingAngle[1] += 0x8000 Cap vel[1] to 0 Set forward velocity to negative  speed  (and update slide and xz velocities to match)"}

Tips To fit in the starting triple jump more consistently, you can hold neutral briefly while airborne during the buffered kick. Doing the whole triple jump with full stick magnitude requires very good early-frame jumps and short A presses. Make sure to long-jump early after entering the slide to land further back and be able to build up speed on the slope before sliding off. While falling, hold up-right to turn, switch to up to clear the slide while avoiding turning too far right to bonk the wall, then switch to down-right/right to drift closer to the bottom of the slide. Switching to holding right with good timing during the slide yields a consistent path across the bridge. Hold up-left as the slide ends to steer towards the door and so shorten the distance of the (following) moonwalk, meaning you'll have enough residual speed to reach the door. Hold up-right after the rollout to moonwalk in the correct direction (you must have passed the finish line facing backwards). Video Load video YouTube YouTube might collect personal data.  Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Advanced Compared to the beginner strat, we also slide across the gap by the far-left corner of the ice bridge, triggering an instant moonwalk. Holding (full-extent) down-right as soon as the moonwalk starts is a setup for hitting the door, but it's very sensitive to angle of approach and minute changes in stick direction (holding closer to right will make Mario turn more, and closer to down will make him turn less).

Load video YouTube YouTube might collect personal data.  Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Tip First red coin : This coin is a little tough to grab. As a beginner, the easiest movement is to double jump kick near the top of the tree. Kicking while in the air prevents Mario from grabbing the pole until he lands. This makes it easy to strafe in the air and ensure you grab the coin. For the advanced movement (buffer kick \u2192 double jump \u2192 dive) to grab the coin, delay the buffered kick slightly so that Mario is closer to his peak double-jump height when you dive at the coin. This helps prevent grabbing the tree out of the dive. Expert Load video YouTube YouTube might collect personal data.

{"prompt": "Explain Lakitu Skip", "completion": "Lakitu Skip  is the first trick runners must perform when doing a run in any category. On the castle moat bridge, Mario can land on the very edge and clear it without triggering Lakitu's dialogue.  Tips Lakitu Skip can be performed on either side of the bridge, but it is faster to do so on the left side. Select a setup that works best for you and stick to it in runs; the trick will become easier as your control over Mario improves. If you are new to the game, it is advised not to reset over missing Lakitu Skip; the ~8 seconds you save from it will not make or break your run until you get to a higher level.   Visual cue.

{"prompt": "Explain Same Input Challenge", "completion": "The  Same Input Challenge 's goal is collecting as many different stars from a single set of inputs as possible, while only varying the savestate for the TAS. The challenge was originally created by  Sidney  and inspired by this  TAS that completed 4 2D Mario games with the same input file , with the goal of \"making a .m64 that can collect two completely different stars with the same .m64, but different .st.\" Rules Must start from star select (if the level has one), pause exit (if a castle star), or on the first frame of level. No leaving a level (including Bowser death) In level warps are fine, as long as they do not exit the course (No DDD exit, Bowser death, TotWC death, etc.) Only one star per save state, 100 coin stars/castle stars must be collected separately Save states must be achievable without the use of hacks (No impossible RNG, impossible HOLP, etc.) Stars must be yellow when collected May not press the start button Current Records Three courses have had all 6 of their main stars done with a single input file and one has had all 7 stars collected so far. These courses are  Wet-Dry World ,  Bob-omb Battlefield ,  Tall, Tall Mountain , and  Whomp's Fortress .  The current BoB record is all 6 main stars in 2:24 by brqm [1] . The run uses star 1 for the first and sixth stars, star 2 for the second star, and star 3 for the third fourth and fifth stars. Differing level versions, cannon activation, and wing cap activation is used to desync the input file. The current WF record is all 7 stars in 2:24 by brqm [2] . This run uses textboxes for  timestop , different course versions,  and different  HOLP  locations. The current CCM record is all 6 main stars in 3:36 by brqm [3] . The current WDW record is all 6 main stars in 6:14 by Nim [4] . The run uses star 1 for all stars. Differing HOLP placements are used to desync the input file. The current TTM record is all 6 main stars in 4:08 by Dabs [5] . The run uses star 1 for the first star and star 2 for the other five. Differing HOLP placements are used to desync the input file after the first star is collected.

{"prompt": "Explain Spawning displacement", "completion": "Spawning displacement  is a technique that allows  Mario  to receive displacement from a moving platform for one  frame  when spawning, hence the name. It is exclusive to the original  Japanese version . Spawning displacement occurs when Mario exits the level (such as through the pause menu, through death, through a warp, or by getting a star) and ends up standing on a moving object for one frame, whether it be an object from the previous level that was moving and unloaded (\"Normal\" Spawning Displacement) or an object in the  castle  that overwrote the object Mario was standing on while exiting the level (\"Reverse\" Spawning Displacement). In other words, Spawning Displacement occurs when exiting a level while standing on either a moving  object  which will not be overwritten by a non-moving object after  unloading  or an object which gets overwritten by a moving object after unloading. Spawning displacement results in Mario being displaced from his typical spawning position. [1] Contents 1   Applications 2   Variations 2.1   Teleport Displacement 2.2   Platform Release Displacement 3   References Applications Mario can utilize spawning displacement to re-enter  Tick Tock Clock  without pressing the A button. This is done by standing on a  spinner  and collecting a Star. Once the spinner rotates, it displaces Mario to spawn lower in the clock, landing on the edge of the clock next to the painting, thereby saving the A press needed to enter TTC. This is done three times in the 120 star run, saving three A presses due to the strict requirements only being applicable with three stars: Stop Time for Red Coins  by standing on a spinner and cloning the star. [2] The Pit and the Pendulums  by kicking a  wall  as he collects the star, to land on the spinners below. [3] Get a Hand  by kicking a wall as he collects the star, to fall towards the spinners below. [4]  A push from a  wall overlap  on the pendulum below the star is required to get enough distance for Mario to ledge grab onto the spinner. Variations Spawning displacement actually would occur on all versions of the game, but the displacement is overwritten before it can have an effect. This happens regardless of what causes the displacement. Simply standing on a moving platform (spawning displacement) has this effect, but so do some other things. Teleport Displacement Teleport displacement  is a different type of platform displacement that is not exclusive to the Japanese version. To perform it,  clone  a teleport point near a moving object so that said object will move after Mario has initiated the teleport. As a result, Mario will be displaced from the teleport's destination. Due to these very rare conditions, this can only be performed in  Wet-Dry World , since this is the only level in which you can clone a teleporter (via  loading zone ) that has a moving platform. [5] Platform Release Displacement Platform release displacement  is displacement that occurs for one frame after releasing a platform. Since platforms cannot normally be held, they must be cloned. Because  falling blocks  in  Whomp's Fortress ,  Big Boo's Haunt , and  Bowser in the Fire Sea  and the octagonal rotating platform in  Wet-Dry World  are the only platforms that can be cloned, these are the only ones that can cause platform release displacement. Since this displacement occurs from the new location of the platform, releasing it remotely at the  HOLP  can cause a very large displacement, which can even cause Mario to enter a  vertical PU .

{"prompt": "Explain PU", "completion": "A diagram of Parallel Universe movement in  Hazy Maze Cave , after  Mario  has returned to the main map. A  Parallel Universe , or  PU , is a region of space located far outside the intended map boundaries that reflects certain aspects, especially the floors and/or ceilings, of the main map. When the game looks for floors below (or ceilings above) a given object, it first \"truncates\" the object's position from a floating point value to a 16-bit integer value. The range of a floating point value is much larger than the range of a 16-bit integer value (which is -2 15  = -32,768 to 2 15  - 1 = 32,767). If a coordinate of the object's position falls outside this range, it \"wraps around\". For example, if one of these floating point values is 40,000, then 40,000 - 65,536 = -25,536 will be used when determining if the object is aligned with a floor or ceiling. This gives the illusion that the floors and ceilings of the main level map are \"copied\" repeatedly in a uniform 3D grid, at a spacing of 65,536 units.   Frame of Peter Fedak's video where he turns Parallel Universes visible using hacks; notice the lack of  objects The truncation responsible for the existence of parallel universes is only performed when determining alignment with floors and ceilings. This means that walls and objects, both of which use floating point arithmetic to determine collision, do not \"exist\" in PUs, unless they are brought there. Due to the extremely high speed required to travel to PUs, they are not accessible from all courses. The courses where PUs can or cannot be accessed are summarized in the tables below. Work is ongoing to try to access PUs in courses such as  Bowser in the Fire Sea  (via  Bully battery ) and demo courses (via massive  Spawning displacement ). Methods to access a PU are: Speed: EBLJ HSW HSP BB Speed Conservation Displacement: Pole Teleport Platform Displacement Note that EBLJ (and other types of BLJs), and BB (Bully battery) cannot be achieved on Shindou versions. Also, if a method requires to set  HOLP  in a PU, then it is only possible to do it on VC (because other versions crash if a camera is in the PU, and by locking camera on the main map, the HOLP wont update, because camera being too far is one of the cases where HOLP doesn't update).

However, these behave completely differently to horizontal PUs. While truncated coordinates are used to  find  the floor below the object and the ceiling above the object, the original floating point values are used to determine what  effect  these surfaces have on the object. For example, when Mario is less than 160 units below the nearest ceiling, he is considered to be \"above\" the ceiling, his vertical speed is killed, and he bonks. If Mario moves to a positive (upward) vertical PU, the \"nearest\" ceiling will be determined based on truncated coordinates, and will therefore be in the main map. But when checking whether he is above this ceiling, floating point coordinates are used instead, and so Mario behaves as though he is stuck in a ceiling. This behavior results in positive vertical PUs appearing to be filled entirely with ceilings. [2] On the other hand, when Mario is below his \"nearest\" floor, he will snap up to it. This means that if Mario moves to a negative vertical PU, he will usually upwarp back to the main PU grid. This is called an  overflow jump , or  OJ  for short. It is typically difficult to get to a vertical PU. In the positive direction, there is a ceiling at  y  = 20,000 that prevents upward movement. We can bypass this ceiling by pressing against OoB, for example by using  hyperspeed flying . We can also use  platform displacement  or  indefinite owl flight  to reach a positive vertical PU. In the negative direction, we can use a  negative jump  to jump downward with large amounts of negative speed, or platform displacement. Travel and movement   Mario looking to the original map from a PU   Mario  BLJing  to a PU Parallel universes have found uses in both speed TASes and the  A Button Challenge  since they allow greater control of movement through a level. PU routing is comparable to movement through a five-dimensional space, as Mario can be modeled as traveling along five axes: three \"relative\" axes describing his position within the map, and two integers to specify which PU he is currently in. These PU axis integers are Mario's coordinates on the PU grid. Mario can adjust his  speed  and  angle  to move relatively around the stage regardless of how many PUs he moves in the  x  or  z  dimensions. Mario's movement is split up into four  quarter steps , and if any of these quarter steps attempts to place Mario out of bounds, his movement is canceled. Therefore in order to move to a PU, Mario's speed must be a multiple of four times the distance between PUs. If Mario takes all four quarter steps, then he will move four PUs in a single frame. This distance is called the  Quadruple Parallel Universe , or  QPU , distance. If one of Mario's quarter steps (other than the first one) ends out of bounds, the game will cut his movement short. In this case, Mario does not travel the full QPU distance, and instead ends at whichever PU he made it to before his intended quarter step became out of bounds. He is then \"QPU misaligned.\" As traveling to PUs involves moving very far from the origin, floating point imprecision can begin to have a significant effect on Mario's position, angle, and collision. When Mario's position becomes large enough, this imprecision will result in the coordinates in PUs becoming so coarse that Mario cannot cross from one coordinate to the next and, eventually, will result in certain PUs being completely unaccessible. Floating point truncation crash While in theory the grid of PUs extends indefinitely, the behavior of the truncation operation becomes \"undefined\" when the floating point value is outside the range -2 31  to 2 31  - 1. The Nintendo 64 and  iQue  Player [3]  versions of the game crash when such a truncation is attempted. The Wii and Wii U virtual console versions of the game do not crash, though it is not currently known whether they wrap around the 32-bit integer range, or cap to the endpoints of the range. Most emulators do not properly emulate the crash, except for a specific version of Mupen64, modded to crash correctly. While movement to PUs at coordinates this large is rarely useful, this crash can occur due to other instances of truncation in the game, even in PUs close to the main map. For example, when determining Mario's tilt while walking, the game multiples Mario's speed by 16,384 and then truncates this value. This means that the game can crash in certain conditions when Mario has a speed of about 131,000, which is below QPU speed. While not all conditions for these types of crashes are known, there are some that come up frequently. These are when: The camera enters a PU Mario bonks while in a PU Mario's quarter step gets canceled while on the ground Mario collides with a wall head-on with PU speed Miscellaneous behavior Certain objects and graphics behave interestingly while in parallel universes.

To complete it, Mario must collect the  Power Star  located in an overhand. Although Mario is supposed to use a cannon, it is very easy to simply wall kick onto the platform.  Contents 1   A Button Challenge 2   TAS 2.1   TAS Strategy 2.2   TAS History  [5] 3   References A Button Challenge At first, this star seems hard to get without pressing A due to its height, but Mario can fall off from the upper platform and dive towards the star, getting it quite easily. This star can be also done buttonless by sliding from a slope onto the middle platform, and simply falling down onto the star.  TAS TAS Strategy Mario begins by heading over to the small ramp on the grass. He performs a  BLJ  and clips into the wall. Mario reaches the area of water. When he touches  water , he is  teleported to the top of the body of water . In this case, the top is at the shallow water area. Mario does this because the platform is too high to reach with a  jump , and that jumping greatly reduces Mario\u2019s  speed . Although he is at the top of the water, he is below the ground still as normally Mario cannot swim in this body of water. He then swims to a small slope leading into the water, so that when he emerges, he can perform a rollout, which helps maintain Mario\u2019s speed and also lands him on the edge of the wet area. This is done because the wet ground is slightly lower than the dry ground surrounding it, meaning that mario has to gain height to continue, which is a problem when Mario has so much speed. He narrowly avoids the edge rail, and turns onto a slope. Mario clips past the cannon bob-omb due to his speed. His angle allows him to launch off of the slope, towards the star, at the right height so that he lands directly on the platform. Mario then performs a kick to collect the star.

{"prompt": "Explain Fall Damage", "completion": "Fall Damage  is damage caused by falling from a high height. There are two types of fall damage:  Small Fall Damage  and  Large Fall Damage . Small fall damage usually occurs whenever Mario's falling faster than 55 units per frame (i.e. he has lower than -55  vertical speed ) and has fallen more than 1150 units from his peak height (the highest height he reached since he last became airborne). Large fall damage usually occurs when Mario is falling faster than 55 units per frame and has fallen more than 3000 units from his peak height. Under some circumstances, Mario will not take fall damage, such as in certain terrain with a relatively steep slope, or when landing on snow, sand (both of these provided you don't dive with Mario facing flat [1] ), and lava. Mario also does not take fall damage if he is twirling. A condition exists within the game for Mario to take damage starting at Mario falling 600 units from his peak height, but this condition is never met in-game . The damage received from each type of fall damage is as follows: 2 sections for small fall damage, 4 sections for large fall damage, and without a hat, these values become 3 and 6 sections respectively. Taking small fall damage also squishes Mario for 30 frames. If Mario is holding something and takes large fall damage, he will drop what he is holding. This can be used to perform  Instant Release .

{"prompt": "Explain No Buttons Allowed Challenge", "completion": "Buttonless Challenge Abbreviation NBA Individual stars collectible 34 Overall stars collectible 0 Is beatable No Star Details BoB WF JRB CCM BBH HMC LLL SSL DDD SL WDW TTM THI TTC RR Secret Castle Bowser The  No Buttons Allowed Challenge  (also known as the  Buttonless Challenge ) forbids the use of A, B, Z, Start, L, R, and (to some extent) C buttons. This challenge was created by pannenkoek2012 to push the game to its limits. The C buttons are only allowed when they only affect the camera and don't affect actual gameplay. For example, the  C^ Hyperspeed  glitch is not allowed. The challenge is more difficult than simply restricting the A button, since this disables many maneuvering options that Mario can use, such as  jumping ,  diving , sliding, and more. The challenge cannot be done as a full game run as there is in-game text that cannot be advanced without the use of buttons. Only 34 stars have been collected, many of which require complicated strategies. Possible Stars Location Mission Notes Bob-omb Battlefield Find the 8 Red Coins Mario can slide off of a hill into the Koopa to knock its shell of, then use  Shell Hyperspeed  to collect the coins on  Chain Chomp 's post and the floating island. The star itself is collected by sliding off a hill and bouncing on Goombas. Behind Chain Chomp's Gate Shell Hyperspeed is also used here to clip inside the gate high enough to collect the star. 100 Coins Shell Hyperspeed is used again to collect coins in the sky, as well as kill Goombas. The star is spawned in a specific spot near the\u00a0! switch so it can be collected by falling from above. Whomp's Fortress Shoot into the Wild Blue The warp is used to get to the top of the stage, then the slope nearby can be used to slide Mario onto the lower platform. The star can be collected by precisely falling off the side of the platform. Blast Away the Wall Mario can  framewalk  up to the area where the star is, then collect it with a precise ledge grab into the wall. Cool, Cool Mountain Slip Slidin' Away Framewalking is used to enter the cabin, then the slide can be completed normally. To collect the star itself, Mario must warp back to the top of the stage and fall on it from above. Frosty Slide for 8 Red Coins The red coin on the tree at the start can be collected by falling from the nearby ledge, and the one at the top of the ski lift can be collected with a precise ledge grab. The one on the tree at the bottom of the stage can be collected by bouncing off of a  Spindrift , and then the star is easily collected by falling from above. Wall Kicks Will Work The strategy for this star is the same as in the  A Button Challenge . Framewalking is used to climb to the peak of the mountain, then Mario slides off with enough speed to bounce on a Spindrift and twirl down to the star. 100 Coins There are plenty of coins obtainable by going down the slide and the outside of the mountain. The final coin collected is the red coin in the corner of the stage, so the star can be collected by walking up the steep slope. Lethal Lava Land Boil the Big Bully Lava boosting can reach all the way to the Big Bully platform and collect the star. The bully is defeated by running into it precisely when it's on the edge of its platform. This star has to be carefully planned to collect enough coins to survive. Bully the Bullies This star can be collected with the same strategies as the previous one. 8-Coin Puzzle with 15 Pieces The puzzle can easily be reached with lava boosts, then collecting all of the coins is easy. Red-Hot Log Rolling The ring of coins on the nearby platform means that it is possible to ride over to the log area with full health. Mario can use one lava boost to get on top of the log, then another to reach the star. 100 Coins The route for this star has to be carefully planned out so Mario can collect enough coins to survive lava boosting around the stage. Shifting Sand Land In the Talons of the Big Bird The pyramid is reached by climbing up a pillar and bouncing on a  Fly Guy . The other Fly Guy is then used to hit  Klepto  and reach the star. Shining Atop the Pyramid The same strategy for reaching the pyramid in the previous star is used. Free Flying for 8 Red Coins Tornadoes and Fly Guys are used to reach the four coins in the sky, break a cork box, and reach the star. Snowman's Land Snowman's Big Head One of the  Moneybags  is lured all the way to the shell block, then  Moneybag Duplication  is used to get enough Moneybags to bounce all the way to the shell block and open it. The shell is used to lure the Fly Guy near the top of the snowman, then use Shell Hyperspeed to reach most of the way up. The lured Fly Guy is then used to twirl into the star. Chill with the Bully The icy water can be easily used to defeat the  Chill Bully  and collect the star. In the Deep Freeze The Moneybags are used again to reach the shell, then Shell Hyperspeed is used to reach the ice block with the star. Whirl from the Freezing Pond Moneybag luring and duplication is used again, but this time enough are duplicated to bounce all the way to the star block to open it and collect the star. Shell Shreddin' for Red Coins Seven of the eight red coins can be easily collected, even without the shell, but the one underneath the Chill Bully platform is very problematic. Moneybag duplication is once again used to get Moneybags underneath the platform, then it is possible to slide with enough speed to reach the red coin, then bounce on Moneybags to escape with enough HP to survive. The star is collected by twirling off of a Fly Guy. 100 Coins Moneybag duplication is used again, this time near the icy water so Mario can boost off it to bounce on duplicated Moneybags and collect their coins. The boosting is also used to collect the star. Wet-Dry World Shocking Arrow Lifts! The warp is used to reach the star platform and a fire bounce can open the star block. The warp is used again to reach the star. Tall, Tall Mountain Scary 'Shrooms, Red Coins Two of the red coins on the mushrooms can be collected easily with the vertical wind, but the other two are problematic. They are possible to collect by luring a Fly Guy and using  Wind Hyperspeed  to twirl off of it at high speeds. This makes it possible to collect the red coins on the other two mushrooms and get back in time to reach the vertical wind again. One of the cliff red coins can be reached by twirling in the vertical wind again, and the other three can be collected by dropping down from above. The star can be reached with the vertical wind. Mysterious Mountainside The star is reached by using the vertical wind to climb up the mountain and twirling off of a fly guy to reach the star. Breathtaking View from Bridge The vertical wind, Fly Guy, and framewalking are used to climb the mountain, and the star is reached by dropping from above. Blast to the Lonely Mushroom The Fly Guy is once again used to twirl to the star. Tiny-Huge Island Pluck the Piranha Flower Framewalking is used to get around the water, then the slope is used to slide and knock the shell of the koopa. This would send Mario into the water, so he has to run into a  Spiny  to stop sliding. The shell is used to reach the  Piranha Plants  and defeat them, and a fire bounce is used to collect the star. Five Itty Bitty Secrets The same method is used to obtain the Koopa shell. This time, it is used to enter the pipe at the top of the mountain to reach the tiny island. From there, several fire bounces are used to climb the mountain slopes and reach each of the secrets. This amount of fire would kill Mario though, so he also has to run into the small Koopa Troopa to knock its  Blue Coin  to the sandy area to regain health. 100 Coins The shell is once again obtained, but this time it is used to enter  Wiggler 's cave. The Koopa Troopa is not defeated yet, so the shell will respawn once Mario exits. Two red coins are collected, then the cave is exited. Mario bounces on a Fly Guy and uses the vertical wind to twirl indefinitely. The twirling is used to defeat several large Goombas and collect their blue coins. The shell is obtained again, this time to get up the mountain. Another Goomba is defeated with a twirl, then Mario climbs to the top of the level to fall into the pipe. Mini Goombas are defeated by dropping onto them, and then Mario drops back into the lower pipe to defeat the Piranha Plants with fire bounces. The final coin is collected next to the steep slope so the star can be obtained by walking up to it. Tick Tock Clock Get a Hand The spinners are climbed by framewalking, only possible on the random setting. A fire bounce is used to get on top of the hand, and then  Pendulum Manipulation  is used to allow Mario to ride the pendulum into the star. Stop Time for Red Coins The red coins are collected by framewalking on the spinners. The star is then obtained with a precise slide off of one of the spinners. Tower of the Wing Cap Red Coin Star Since Mario starts the course flying, it is easy to collect the red coins and star.

{"prompt": "Explain Parallel Universe", "completion": "A diagram of Parallel Universe movement in  Hazy Maze Cave , after  Mario  has returned to the main map. A  Parallel Universe , or  PU , is a region of space located far outside the intended map boundaries that reflects certain aspects, especially the floors and/or ceilings, of the main map. When the game looks for floors below (or ceilings above) a given object, it first \"truncates\" the object's position from a floating point value to a 16-bit integer value. The range of a floating point value is much larger than the range of a 16-bit integer value (which is -2 15  = -32,768 to 2 15  - 1 = 32,767). If a coordinate of the object's position falls outside this range, it \"wraps around\". For example, if one of these floating point values is 40,000, then 40,000 - 65,536 = -25,536 will be used when determining if the object is aligned with a floor or ceiling. This gives the illusion that the floors and ceilings of the main level map are \"copied\" repeatedly in a uniform 3D grid, at a spacing of 65,536 units.   Frame of Peter Fedak's video where he turns Parallel Universes visible using hacks; notice the lack of  objects The truncation responsible for the existence of parallel universes is only performed when determining alignment with floors and ceilings. This means that walls and objects, both of which use floating point arithmetic to determine collision, do not \"exist\" in PUs, unless they are brought there. Due to the extremely high speed required to travel to PUs, they are not accessible from all courses. The courses where PUs can or cannot be accessed are summarized in the tables below. Work is ongoing to try to access PUs in courses such as  Bowser in the Fire Sea  (via  Bully battery ) and demo courses (via massive  Spawning displacement ). Methods to access a PU are: Speed: EBLJ HSW HSP BB Speed Conservation Displacement: Pole Teleport Platform Displacement Note that EBLJ (and other types of BLJs), and BB (Bully battery) cannot be achieved on Shindou versions. Also, if a method requires to set  HOLP  in a PU, then it is only possible to do it on VC (because other versions crash if a camera is in the PU, and by locking camera on the main map, the HOLP wont update, because camera being too far is one of the cases where HOLP doesn't update).

However, these behave completely differently to horizontal PUs. While truncated coordinates are used to  find  the floor below the object and the ceiling above the object, the original floating point values are used to determine what  effect  these surfaces have on the object. For example, when Mario is less than 160 units below the nearest ceiling, he is considered to be \"above\" the ceiling, his vertical speed is killed, and he bonks. If Mario moves to a positive (upward) vertical PU, the \"nearest\" ceiling will be determined based on truncated coordinates, and will therefore be in the main map. But when checking whether he is above this ceiling, floating point coordinates are used instead, and so Mario behaves as though he is stuck in a ceiling. This behavior results in positive vertical PUs appearing to be filled entirely with ceilings. [2] On the other hand, when Mario is below his \"nearest\" floor, he will snap up to it. This means that if Mario moves to a negative vertical PU, he will usually upwarp back to the main PU grid. This is called an  overflow jump , or  OJ  for short. It is typically difficult to get to a vertical PU. In the positive direction, there is a ceiling at  y  = 20,000 that prevents upward movement. We can bypass this ceiling by pressing against OoB, for example by using  hyperspeed flying . We can also use  platform displacement  or  indefinite owl flight  to reach a positive vertical PU. In the negative direction, we can use a  negative jump  to jump downward with large amounts of negative speed, or platform displacement. Travel and movement   Mario looking to the original map from a PU   Mario  BLJing  to a PU Parallel universes have found uses in both speed TASes and the  A Button Challenge  since they allow greater control of movement through a level. PU routing is comparable to movement through a five-dimensional space, as Mario can be modeled as traveling along five axes: three \"relative\" axes describing his position within the map, and two integers to specify which PU he is currently in. These PU axis integers are Mario's coordinates on the PU grid. Mario can adjust his  speed  and  angle  to move relatively around the stage regardless of how many PUs he moves in the  x  or  z  dimensions. Mario's movement is split up into four  quarter steps , and if any of these quarter steps attempts to place Mario out of bounds, his movement is canceled. Therefore in order to move to a PU, Mario's speed must be a multiple of four times the distance between PUs. If Mario takes all four quarter steps, then he will move four PUs in a single frame. This distance is called the  Quadruple Parallel Universe , or  QPU , distance. If one of Mario's quarter steps (other than the first one) ends out of bounds, the game will cut his movement short. In this case, Mario does not travel the full QPU distance, and instead ends at whichever PU he made it to before his intended quarter step became out of bounds. He is then \"QPU misaligned.\" As traveling to PUs involves moving very far from the origin, floating point imprecision can begin to have a significant effect on Mario's position, angle, and collision. When Mario's position becomes large enough, this imprecision will result in the coordinates in PUs becoming so coarse that Mario cannot cross from one coordinate to the next and, eventually, will result in certain PUs being completely unaccessible. Floating point truncation crash While in theory the grid of PUs extends indefinitely, the behavior of the truncation operation becomes \"undefined\" when the floating point value is outside the range -2 31  to 2 31  - 1. The Nintendo 64 and  iQue  Player [3]  versions of the game crash when such a truncation is attempted. The Wii and Wii U virtual console versions of the game do not crash, though it is not currently known whether they wrap around the 32-bit integer range, or cap to the endpoints of the range. Most emulators do not properly emulate the crash, except for a specific version of Mupen64, modded to crash correctly. While movement to PUs at coordinates this large is rarely useful, this crash can occur due to other instances of truncation in the game, even in PUs close to the main map. For example, when determining Mario's tilt while walking, the game multiples Mario's speed by 16,384 and then truncates this value. This means that the game can crash in certain conditions when Mario has a speed of about 131,000, which is below QPU speed. While not all conditions for these types of crashes are known, there are some that come up frequently. These are when: The camera enters a PU Mario bonks while in a PU Mario's quarter step gets canceled while on the ground Mario collides with a wall head-on with PU speed Miscellaneous behavior Certain objects and graphics behave interestingly while in parallel universes.

Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Walkthrough Beginning Regardless of the route or strats you choose for this star, the first room will always be the same. Hold back and kick after killing the scuttlebugs to safely grab all 3 coins from each. To make sure you grab the entire row of 5 coins on the righthand ledge, wait to dive until  after  you grab the first coin in the row.  Make sure you enter the door to the Reds Room in lakitu C-Up and mash C-Right at the door in order to reduce lag, and to setup the cam for the beginning of the next area.

Pay attention to the input displays in each of the vids to understand what to hold for each strat. If you didn't mash C-Right before entering the room, your camera may act differently here If your goal is to make Early Spider Cycle, you need to land directly on the elevator from the wall kicks since rolling out onto the elevator costs too much time to make the cycle The videos below press C-Down after the last wall kick. Alternatively, you can press C-Down as you perform the 2nd wallkick. Refer to Tabascoth's tutorial above. Load video Local File Local File might collect personal data.

Continue Dismiss https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/File:Hmc100ljwkonelevator.mp4     Expert - Longjump wallkick, land on elevator After the first 2 red coins, there are a few movement options to choose from. For beginners and intermediate players, it's recommended that you ride the elevator to the 3rd red and longjump ledge-grab to the 4th red. For more advanced players, you can longjump from the elevator to the corkbox, and then longjump from the corkbox into the 3rd red, sliding off the black pillar to jump and wallkick to the 4th red. As mentioned above, if your beginning wasn't fast enough, the cycle of the spider after the 5th red will change the route slightly. For the Beginner strat; time your long jump to happen after the red coin shadow appears on the elevator aim for the right side of the platform where the 4th red is to avoid any collision issues Turning the camera with C-Lefts after the first 2 reds is important for console players as it reduces a lot of lag If you make a mistake and can't catch up to the elevator, just wait for it to respawn As you exit the Reds Room, be in lakitu cam C-Up and mash C-Right at the door to reduce lag   Backup for missed 4th red coin which doesn't require riding the platform again. Pressing Z to squat allows you to buffer straight down for the start of the sideflip. Load video Local File Local File might collect personal data.

Slide-kicking into the hole is a little safer but costs a few frames. For the blue coin switch, you can longjump up to the platform to single-jump and groundpound the switch, or you can save some time by performing a dive rollout on the platform, and as you land on the switch, quickly sideflip and groundpound to reorient yourself towards the blue coins. These videos begin with C-Right mashing for lag reduction which affects the camera as you go through the first door. Load video Local File Local File might collect personal data.

As an expert strat, you can skip the elevator room by triple jumping over the wall (Salt Bog strat).   To avoid bonking at the elevator, C-left buffer before the door, then move to the center of the elevator and stop once, and then go full left notch.

Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Red Coin Room Part 2 There are 2 main variations when you re-enter the Red Coin room at the end of the star. The time difference for each strat is heavily dependent on where the blue coin from the eye falls which is based on RNG. Grabbing the red coin to the right first makes the blue coin spawn later, making it less likely that the coin will despawn if you make a mistake. However the drawback is that it's more difficult to react to the blue coin quickly for an optimal time. The video below shows the two routes side-by-side with good and bad blue coin RNG for reference. In terms of probability, 36900 / 65114 RNG values work (56.67%) in making the blue coin fall off the platform, and the coin will fall off directly towards the star about 2% of the time.

During  Walking ,  Decelerating , and  Crawling , 29 speed is required, otherwise Mario will  punch  (which may get immediately cancelled into a jump kick, see  Speedkick ). When initiated from a ground action, Mario is given 20 vertical speed alongside the dive. However, this is not part of the dive action, and as such diving does not affect vertical speed when initiated from any other action. Transition In See  single jump  for more details Mario gains 15 horizontal speed Mario's horizontal speed is capped to 48. Behavior The dive action can transition into  Dive Slide ,  Dive Picking Up , and  Head Stuck in Ground  by landing, and  Backwards Air Knockback  by bonking. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022

Coins Bob-omb Battlefield has a total of 146 coins collectible without the aid of glitches, but only 141 coins can be collected with the first three stars selected. With the aid of glitches, the number of coins can be raised, namely by using the  breaking-disappearing cork box glitch ,  cloning , or  ride canceling . Cloning can only produce a certain amount of coins before the object limit is reached, but the cork box and Koopa shell glitches can be used to get infinite coins.

reflection off of trees, king bob-omb fast strat, and reducing lag frames] A Press Counts In the A Button Challenge, it takes no A Presses to collect all seven stars. The Wing Cap, unlocked by pressing the switch in  Tower of the Wing Cap , is required to complete  Mario Wings to the Sky  (by using  Hat-in-Hand  glitch). Though, it may be possible to use  Behind Camera Anywhere  instead of the wing cap, but it is unverified.  Star A Presses Minutes 1 0 2 2 0 2 3 0 1 4 0 2 5 0 42* 6 0 1 100 0 3 *56 minutes including setting HOLP in BoB. Entering Bob-omb Battlefield  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/mlHzqJn2SMs   This part is easily done without pressing  A  by using a dive recover into the painting. Big Bob-omb on the Summit  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/h8MjSIMekrg   Scaling the mountain is easily done even without using the teleporters near the flowers or using the mountain warp. As the geometry of the course is mostly flat, there should be no difficulty even when climbing up the mountain. Simply scale the mountain and defeat King Bob-omb without pressing A.  Footrace with Koopa The Quick  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/ERlN9BDxBcw   This one is harder as it involves speed, but still possible. Talk to Koopa the Quick and start running. The tilting bridge can be crossed by waiting a while at one end, then slide kicking off of the other. Afterwards, simply scale the mountain. At no point is pressing A mandatory. Shoot to the Island in the Sky  (0x) Video 1 (Goomba Bridge):  https://youtu.be/54iInYhelg4   Video 2 (Shell Hyperspeed):  https://youtu.be/vGCclfj6YC0   Completing this star is not easy. Initially, Pannenkoek ended up constructing a  Goomba Bridge  to get to the island and placing a Bowling Ball directly underneath the star. Grabbing a cork box, he went back up his Goomba Bridge and grabbed it as it turned fake to clone another Goomba. Finally, he released the Goomba by getting knocked back by the bowling ball and opened the star's item block using the said knockback, then the Goomba clone facilitated Mario to gain enough height to reach the star, as the star is 313 units above ground [2] . Eventually, in 2017, Pannenkoek used Shell Hyperspeed to complete the star by accumulating negative speed with the shell, reaching over -440 with which he went to the mountaintop, and launching towards the floating island. Mario then ground pounds the item block in midair to collect the star. Find the 8 Red Coins  (0x) Video 1 (Goomba Bridge):  https://youtu.be/9RUSM-aqQeM   Video 2 (Shell Hyperspeed):  https://youtu.be/BB5RpMUNAV4   Since most of the coins are relatively easy to get, all effort goes into the one red coin located on the floating island. Luckily, there are many ways to collect it. In the initial run, Pannenkoek utilized the previously mentioned  Goomba Bridge , as seen in the previous star. After the seven other coins were easily collected, he constructed a Goomba Bridge towards the island.  Eventually, in the second video, Pannenkoek used Shell Hyperspeed to accumulate high negative speed with the shell and launches towards the floating island using the previously described method. The shell also has the benefit of speeding up the collection of the remaining coins. Mario Wings to the Sky  (0x) Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpcMlj8BwWE   The first three secrets can be collected by using  Shell Hyperspeed  and launching off the top of the mountain. The other two secrets are way too high for that, so Pannenkoek had to use a different. Pannenkoek first sets the HOLP at a precise point high above the floating island by making a  Goomba Bridge  with 28 Goomba clones. He then exits the course to unload them, so the game wouldn't crash from the large number of Goomba clones. After re-entering, he uses the shell to reach the first three secrets, before performing the Hat-in Hand glitch. He uses  Transport Cloning  to create a  Goomba Oasis  with 7 precisely-placed Goomba clones that end up near the highest secret. He then creates another Goomba Bridge with 36 Goomba clones that led up to the Goomba Oasis. After that, he was able to use the Goomba Bridge to reach the 5th secret, then use the Goombas in the Oasis to turn around and fall into the 4th secret. This strategy uses 43 Goomba clones, which is a lot for the game to handle. This is why the was impossible to collect 0xA before the discovery of the Goomba Cluster and Goomba Oasis, as earlier strategies would have many more Goombas and would undoubtedly crash the game. Behind Chain Chomp's Gate  (0x) Video 1 (Goomba clone):  https://youtu.be/s87uNx50j38   Video 2 (Shell Hyperspeed):  https://youtu.be/7s2qptzjcJ8   Video 3 (Death Clip):  https://youtu.be/F5n5csEyCws Getting Behind the Gate is easy, but getting the star is not. First, Pannenkoek did some manipulation to reliably get Goomba  clones . Then, he went behind the gate using a cork box and used that same box to clone the Goombas in such a way that he could ascend to the star using a  Goomba Staircase .  Eventually, in the second video, Pannenkoek uses Shell Hyperspeed to accumulate higher than -500 speed to clip behind the gate with enough height to collect the star behind the gate. BoB 100 Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/gSVIl_DMyXc   This star requires getting all coins except the one red on the Floating Island and the coins in  Mario Wings to the Sky . After collecting the easily accessible coins, Pannenkoek  clones  a singular yellow coin for the star. Even without cloning, the shiny shell (accessible from Star 3 onward) can also greatly facilitate in collecting the coins of the course and reach the floating island via  Backwards Shell Hyperspeed . Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected.  Mario Wings to the Sky  is the most challenging mission to complete, as it requires the use of  Parallel Universes  for the first four secrets and a complicated setup to achieve a high  VSC  while holding a fake object for the fifth secret [3] . The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  Find the 8 Red Coins ,  Behind Chain Chomp's Gate , and  100 Coins  can be collected [4] . In a  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , all seven stars can be collected without using the joystick. However, some of these stars are completed using the  Wing Cap , which can not be obtained during a full-game run, as it requires looking up in the castle. [5] . In the  Pacifist Challenge , every star except for  Big Bob-omb on the Summit  can be collected in isolation. However,  Footrace with Koopa the Quick  can not be collected in a full-game run since it is impossible to select. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 3 B presses, all three used to pick up King Bob-omb. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses.  Behind Chain Chomp's Gate  requires a bomb clip to avoid ground pounding on the post. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Shoot to the Island in the Sky  and  Behind Chain Chomp's Gate  can be collected. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to ground pound on Chain Chomp's post without interacting with the red coin.

{"prompt": "Explain Hyperspeed Water Sliding", "completion": "Hyperspeed Water Sliding   or  HSWS  is a technique to repeatedly gain speed via  C^ Hyperspeed  followed by entering  water . Going into water conserves  sliding speed , which can be used to gain speed by conserving that speed back into a sliding state. Contents 1   Execution 2   Non-slippery Slope Variant 3   Uses 4   References Execution This uses the C^ Hyperspeed trick and sliding speed conversion. On a  slippery slope  with water, pressing Z the frame Mario leaves the water will set his  horizontal speed  to his sliding speed, which is how sliding speed is conserved out of water. However, this puts Mario into a crouching action. By pressing C-Up on the same frame Z was pressed, i.e. pressing both Z and C-Up on the frame Mario leaves the water, the crouch will be cancelled and Mario will start going into first person. By leaving the water into a slippery slope, the braking caused by pressing C-Up will cause Mario to initiate  C^ Hyperspeed  on the slope, which adds to the speed that was originally conserved into the water. Mario can then enter the water again after the speed is gained and repeat the process. Non-slippery Slope Variant HSWS can also be performed on  nonslippery slopes  by staying on the slope for 1  frame  at a time. [1]  The speed gained from this trick asymptotes at ~100. Uses A Button Challenge  - The non-slippery slope variant is used to gain speed quickly for  Treasure of the Ocean Cave  0.5xA and  Blast to the Stone Pillar  0xA. It was formerly used in  Metal-Head Mario Can Move!  0xA although it has been obsoleted.

If actionArg is 0, Mario's forward velocity is set to 0 Behavior todo Gravity Just like  Star Fall , the y-velocity decreases by 3.2 each frame with minimum velocity -65 instead of -75 Applications Speedrunning Some speedrunners use Lava Boost as a means to get around levels such as  Lethal Lava Land  faster. This is primarily useful for skipping long sections of the map, as instead of avoiding damage you can take a couple of hits to clear stars much faster. Vertical Speed Conservation If Mario lands on a floor after a lava boost, his vertical speed will not be set to 0. At max, Mario can have VSC80.

The level is themed around going from one world to another, and interacting with how the size changes affect the world. There are 2 paintings leading to THI, on the second floor behind a door with a star on it. One is a smaller painting which takes you directly to the tiny version of the course, and the other is a much larger painting that takes you to the huge version of the course.

To complete it, Mario must collect the eight  Red Coins  scattered throughout the level. Contents 1   Locations 2   A Button Challenge 3   TAS Strategy 4   TAS History 5   References Locations The locations of the coins are: One on top of a rock near the cannon under the island One on the grassy slope at the start of the mountain path One behind bars under the bridge connecting the flat grassy area with the start of the mountain One on the floating island One on the  Chain Chomp 's pole One above the elevators Two at the 4 wooden poles, where the star spawns A Button Challenge This star can be collected in 0 A presses and in real time. Most of the coins can be collected pretty easily without using A.  Shell hyperspeed  is used to reach the red coin on the island. TAS Strategy Mario begins by jumping onto the slope to the right of where he spawns, and sliding down to get forward speed to get the wing cap from the box beside the bridge quickly. Then Mario runs over to the elevator and grabs the Red Coin there, before doing a  BLJ  on the elevator to get the Red Coin on the small rock, then getting the Red Coin above the Chain Chomp's pole. Mario crosses the bridge and grabs a tree to redirect his speed to grab one of the coins beside the space where the star spawns, then triple jumping and bouncing off of the edge of the level in flight to get the Red Coin on the grassy slope on the mountain path then go back up into the air, then fly down to grab the Red Coin above the tree on the floating island. He then flies towards the bars under the bridge that can turn, and he has enough speed to clip through it and collect the Red Coin. He lands and does a quick triple jump wallkick to keep his speed and fly over to the last Red Coin and land to collect it, then grabs the star.

{"prompt": "Explain Movement Steps", "completion": "Typically, Mario's position is updated incrementally using his velocity. These increments are called  steps , and they behave differently when Mario is on the ground, in the air, in water, hanging, and climbing a pole. When on the ground or in the air, these steps typically occur four times per frame, and are commonly referred to as  quarter steps  or colloquially  quarter frames . Steps are also responsible for detecting collision with  surfaces , updating Mario's  referenced surfaces , and updating Mario's  water level . However, quarter steps don't detect object collisions or warps. Contents 1   Stationary Step 2   Air Step 2.1   Quarter-Frame Checks 2.2   Perform Air Step 2.3   Common Air Step Results 2.4   Common Air Knockback Step Stationary Step https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64/blob/66018e9f3caaa67399218971d61366cb3f7ba7d7/src/game/mario_step.c#L236 Mario's x and z forward velocity and sliding velocity is set to 0 mario_update_moving_sand mario_update_windy_ground If updated by moving sand or windy ground, return perform_ground_step Else, set Mario's y position to the floor, (possibly causing a  downwarp ), and update graphics. Return GROUND_STEP_NONE. Also see  Idle#stationary ground step Air Step Certain things here are more explained on their individual pages. If something lacks detail, check the link for more information. When an action performs a  common  air step, the first thing Mario does is update his horizontal velocity/sideways position via  straining . This is only for the common air step and is not part of the quarter-frame checks. Quarter-Frame Checks After that is updated, the movement is split into \"quarter-steps\" that breakdown Mario's movement and determine what his outcome of each step is. The checks for the quarter-steps are as follows: The position a quarter of Mario's velocity ahead of Mario is checked for cancels/outcomes. Anything in bold is an exit out of the rest of the checks. If the position is above OOB but below Mario's current floor height, Mario's height is changed to the floor height and he  lands . If the position is above OOB but not below Mario's current floor height, Mario's height is set to the new height and he  hits a wall . If the action has the  \"riding shell\" flag  and the water level at the position is above the position's floor (up to 78 units above the position): The floor height from here on is the water height. The floor from this point on is a \"fake\" floor on the surface of the water. The floor's origin offset is set to the water height. If the position's height is 78 units or less below a floor and there is not a ceiling 160 units or less above it (because of how variable types an  overflow jump  may occur here): Mario's position horizontally is updated to the new position. Mario's height is set to that of the floor's height. Mario's floor and floor height are updated. Mario  lands . If the position's height is 78 units or less below a floor and there is a ceiling 160 units or less above it (because of how variable types an  overflow jump  may occur here): Mario's height is set to that of the floor's height. Mario  lands . (Because Mario's floor is not updated, this is where a  pedro spot  may occur) If the position's height is 160 units under, at, or above a ceiling and his vertical velocity is positive or zero: Mario's vertical velocity is set to zero. If the ceiling above Mario is hangable and the air step has the  \"check hang\" flag , Mario  hangs . (Since this did not use the new position's ceiling/location, this is potentially a  hangable-ceiling upwarp. ) Otherwise,  nothing happens . If the position's height is 160 units under, at, or above a ceiling and his vertical velocity is negative: If the position's height is at or below Mario's floor height, Mario's height is set to the floor height, and he  lands . Otherwise, Mario's height is set to the new height and he  hits a wall . If there is a wall 30 units above the position but not 150 units above the position and the air step has the  \"check ledge grab\" flag : If Mario's velocity is positive, Mario is pushed by the wall opposite the velocity direction, and there is a floor 60 units behind the wall within 238 units upward, Mario  ledge grabs . (Potentially a  GLG ) Otherwise Mario's position is set to the new position, his floor and floor height are updated, and  nothing happens . Mario's position is set to the new position and his floor and floor height are updated. If Mario is colliding with a wall 150 or 30 units up and the upper or only wall is lava, he  lava wall boosts . If Mario is colliding with a wall 150 or 30 units up and Mario is facing perpendicular to 0x6000 units away, he  hits a wall . If no other exit has occurred,  nothing happens . This repeats until Mario encounters something besides  nothing happens , up to four times including the initial time. Mario tracks his \"exit\", with  nothing happens  being tracked if the whole process completed four times. Perform Air Step Set Mario's wall to null (this is a loop) Do 4 times: Let the next intended position be Mario's position plus velocity/4 Perform an air quarter step, where \"new position\" means \"next intended position\" btw, as shown above If nothing happens, continue loop, else exit loop Let stepResult be the result of the last air quarter step performed If Mario's y velocity is positive, set peak height to Mario's y position (the peak height field is used for things like fall damage) Mario's step noise is updated based on his floor. If Mario is not flying,  gravity  is applied. Vertical wind  is now applied/accounted for. Mario's visual position is updated to Mario's position. Mario's yaw is updated to match the in-game angle. Return stepResult Common Air Step Results If doing a common air step, Mario now decides what to do based off the \"exit\" from Perform Air Step. Here is what he does for each exit: Nothing Happens : Mario's animation is now applied. Lands : If Mario is not over a hard  surface , the  terrain  is either snow or desert, Mario's peak height is more than 1000 units above him, the surface does not belong to an object, and the Y normal of the surface is not less than .8660254 (square root of 3 divided by 2): Mario plays an OOF noise, dependent on which  version of the game . Mario spawns particles. Mario's action is set to the  feet stuck in ground  action and the  lands  checks stop. If Mario's action is not twirling, the floor is not lava, his negative velocity is less than -55, and the distance from the peak height to Mario is more than 3000 units: Mario is hurt by 16 (24 without his hat). The camera shakes. Mario plays the \"attacked\" noise. Mario is set to the  hard backward ground knockback  action and the  lands  checks stop. If Mario's action is not twirling, the floor is not lava, his negative velocity is less than -55, and the distance from the peak height to Mario is more than 1150 units: Mario is hurt by 8 (12 without his hat). Mario is squished for 30. The camera shakes. Mario plays the \"attacked\" noise. Mario is set to his action's landing action. Hits a Wall : Mario's animation is now applied. If Mario's forward velocity is more than 16 and is in contact with a physical wall/surface: Mario's yaw is \"reflected\" across the most recent wall Mario collided with, up to the first 4 walls. (This can be glitchy with more than 1 wall, i.e.  unreferenced walls ). Mario plays a noise depending on whether or not he is wearing a metal cap. If Mario's forward velocity is more than 16 and he is not in contact with a physical wall/surface (i.e. OOB): A different sound is played, but Mario's yaw is not reflected. If Mario is in contact with a wall, his action is set to the  air hit wall  action. If Mario is not in contact with a wall (i.e. hitting OOB): Any positive vertical speed is capped to 0. If Mario's forward velocity is 38 or more, spawn particles and set his action to the  backward air knockback  action. If Mario's forward velocity is more than 8 but less than 38, set Mario's forward speed to -8 and set his action to the  soft bonk  action. If Mario's forward velocity is 16 or less (initially, not after these other changes), set the forward velocity to 0. Ledge Grabs Mario's animation is set the idle ledge grab animation. Mario enters the  ledge grab  action while dropping any held objects and no longer riding a shell. Hangs Mario's action is set to the  start hanging  action. Lava Wall Boosts Mario's yaw is set perpendicular to the wall. Mario's forward speed is capped to 24. If Mario is not wearing a metal cap, he is hurt 12 (or 18 without his hat). Mario plays the noise for being burned. The camera preset is set to the area's default preset. Mario enters the  lava boost  action while dropping any held objects and no longer riding a shell. Common Air Knockback Step Similar to Common Air Step, it uses the \"exit\" from Perform Air Step. This function takes in a  landing action , a  hard fall action , and a  speed . Before calling Perform Air Step, it sets Mario's speed to  speed . Common Air Knockback Step can cancel into  Feet Stuck In Ground ,  landing action , and  hard fall action . Mario cannot  Hang  or  Ledge Grab .  Nothing Happens  and  Lava Wall Boosts  (contains cancel  Lava Boost ) are the same as for Perform Air Step. Lands If should get stuck in ground, drop and set action to  Feet Stuck In Ground If y-velocity less than negative 55 and floor is not lava, If fell more than 3000 units, shake camera, play MARIO_SOUND_ATTACKED, and drop and set mario action to the  hard fall action  with argument 4 Else if fell more than 1500 units and floor is not slippery Hurt counter += 8 if cap, else 12 Squish counter += 30 If neither of the first two checks canceled, set action to  landing action  (not changing the action argument, though there are differences in the Japanese version where the  Thrown Forward  and  Thrown Backward  intermediate actions cause the landing action argument to be hurtCounter) Hits a wall Change to the background air kb Animation If Mario's wall is not null Mario's facingAngle[1] = wallAngle - (s32)(facingAngle[1] - wallAngle) basically this step added two wallAngle play either METAL_BONK or BONK sound else play HIT sound facingAngle[1] += 0x8000 Cap vel[1] to 0 Set forward velocity to negative  speed  (and update slide and xz velocities to match)"}
{"prompt": "Explain Misalignment", "completion": "  Mario in a misalignment [1]   A misalignment exists on every corner of axis-aligned edges facing away from the origin   A graphic showing the difference between a misalignment and an open corner A  Misalignment  is a 1x1-unit area a floor hitbox extends to but wall hitboxes do not. On convex corners, they allow Mario to snap up to the floor from up to 78 units below it, as opposed to just 30 units when there is a wall hitbox present. It is the same truncation responsible for  Parallel Universes  that causes misalignment; because floor and ceiling detection is done with integers, all decimal places are removed. If Mario has the right position off the floor, his position will be rounded to a spot on the floor, making the floor appear to extend to his actual position. Walls do not do this, since they use floating-point numbers, which causes the floor to not properly align with its adjacent walls. Contents 1   Uses 1.1   WR TAS Time Saves 1.2   A Button Challenge 2   References Uses WR TAS Time Saves Because they allow lower jumps to reach ledges and cancel air actions immediately, they are useful for saving time in TASes regardless of their demanded precision. Timesaves: TODO A Button Challenge Because of the extra height they allow Mario to gain and the ability to get directly under the floor, they're very useful in the A button challenge. They also require almost no setup or allow less setup than otherwise, which makes them the preferred method over many other ABC strats. Uses include: Stage Mission Use Whomp's Fortress Chip off Whomp's Block Getting onto King Whomp with  stored VS , enabling Mario to ground-pound him without help from the elevator. This also removes the need to clone the star as Mario can ground-pound King Whomp at the star spawn location. [2] To the Top of the Fortress Getting onto a tower platform from the Bullet Bill launcher, which removes the need for slow  HOLP  setting in  BOB  as well as both the wing and metal cap. [3] Big Boo's Haunt Secret of the Haunted Books Used along with a  Glitchy Ledge Grab  to climb the stairs to the second floor [4] [5] . This removed the need to defeat all five Boos on the ground floor for every mission. Seek the 8 Red Coins Big Boo's Balcony Also used to climb the stairs, as well as entering the back room of the mansion for  Scuttlebug Raising [6] . Big Boo's Balcony also had a former strategy that used a misalignment to get on the roof, but it has been outdated [7] Eye to Eye in the Secret Room Hazy Maze Cave Watch for Rolling Rocks  (formerly) Ground pounding into a misalignment to get enough height to land on the star platform, used in the 0.5x strategy [8] . The current 0x strategy uses a  Glitchy Ledge Grab  instead to reach the platform. Shifting Sand Land Inside the Ancient Pyramid A misalignment can be used to get on the Grindel, and from there to get onto the elevator to reach the star [9] . This makes it possible to collect the star 1xA from the bottom entrance, and while it doesn't currently save any A presses, it made progress for a potential A press save on the star. Dire, Dire Docks Board Bowser's Sub Misalignments on the cork boxes are used to reach the poles and sub [10] . Pole-Jumping for Red Coins Through the Jet Stream Collect the Caps... 100 Coins Tiny-Huge Island All missions (formerly) Misalignments were used to enter the pipe several times to perform the Piranha Plant Glitch to get enough coins to perform a Star Dance Clip. The strategy was obsoleted with a completely different one that involved Goomba bounces [11] . Tick Tock Clock Roll into the Cage A misalignment on the cog makes it possible to store VSC and reach the cage without a preset HOLP [12] . The Pit and the Pendulums  (formerly) Also used to climb the cogs without a preset HOLP [13] . The current 0x strategy for the three stars uses a squish cancel ground pound chain instead. Stomp on the Thwomp  (formerly) Timed Jumps on Moving Bars  (formerly) Rainbow Ride Cruiser Crossing the Rainbow A misalignment, along with VSC and a Lakitu bounce, is used to reach the flying ship [14] . Somewhere Over the Rainbow 100 Coins Vanish Cap under the Moat Red Coin Star Two misalignments are used to get on top of the Vanish Cap Switch [15] . Bowser in the Dark World Completion A misalignment is used to get onto the platform with the moving yellow block [16] . This removed the need to perform VSC. A misalignment is also used to enter the pipe [17] . Bowser in the Sky Completion A series of misalignments is used to climb the first few platforms, and another one is used to enter the final pipe [18] [19] . The Castle Pound the Pillars Two misalignments are used to ground pound on the pillars to drain the moat [20] . This removed the need to slowly bring MIPS all the way to the pillars. Go to  Bowser in the Sky Several misalignments, along with a Glitchy Ledge Grab, are used to climb the stairs [21] .

It can be accessed from the painting on the left side of the room near the door to  Bob-omb Battlefield , on the first floor of Princess Peach's castle. The door leading to it requires at least 3 Power Stars to be opened.

Keep in mind that if there are any blue stars (uncollected) present in the star selection menu, then the last version that can be selected is the first blue star and not the stars after it: Version 1 : Accessed by selecting Star 1. The penguin is not present to challenge Mario at sliding. Version 2 : Accessed by selecting Star 2, 3, 4, and 6. The penguin is present, challenging Mario to the race. Version 3 : Accessed by selecting Star 5. This version is identical to Version 2 except that the snowman's body is present to allow Mario to bring it down to meet its head. Additionally, the penguin will become a fat penguin once 120 stars are collected. Coins The coin placement in this course is unique, with how half of the coins are in the main area, and half are in the slide. If all of the coins are collected, a maximum of 154 coins are collectible. There is a theoretical way to raise this maximum - with the use of penguin  Time Stop , you could collect coins and then enter the chimney to get infinite coins. However, no method has been successful in getting Mario to the chimney, and the max height reached is only near the blue coin block.

Slip Slidin' Away  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/vqbq-yeLWbI   Since Mario already starts out at higher grounds of the course, and there are teleporters available to teleport Mario back to the top, this star presents no issues. That being said, frame-walking or dive grinding is required to get up a slope to reach the chimney that leads to the slide. Once exiting out the slide, the star is reachable with a precise dive recover (the star is only 257 units above ground [2] ). Li'l Penguin Lost  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/oXAjWluPjho   Mario frame-walks or dive grinding up the slope to reach where the little penguin is. He then grabs it, sliding down the mountain to give the baby back to mother penguin. The rewarded star is above the maximum height that a dive recover can reach (288 units), and thus, Mario needs to use vertical wind or teleport all the way back to the top and drop down from above to collect the star. Big Penguin Race  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/TQMbgDeAMRU   Enter the slide in the same fashion done in Star 1, and then beat the penguin in the race. Afterwards, collect the star. Frosty Slide for 8 Red Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/XH2exVpK6EI   Seven of the eight red coins require no tricky techniques, but the one at the top of the ski lift is a bit more difficult as the walls around the platform are too high to dive recover onto. There are a few different ways to collect it, with the original one being to activate the ski lift, quickly warp back to the top of the stage, collect the red coin, and land back on the ski lift as its moving down. It is also possible to collect it and survive using a precise ledge grab, a slide kick bounce, or a misalignment. Snowman's Lost His Head  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/t_ETEIo3fvs   With the convenient slope located in the beginning, Mario can reach the Snowman's body and help it roll down the mountain to reach its head with Mario's guidance. While the star is too high to reach without jumping, there is a Spindrift nearby to provide the necessary height to reach it. Wall Kicks Will Work  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/NnC5n70j1KE   The main trick is landing on a  Spindrift  to activate twirling, then use a specific trajectory with a high speed to reach the star from above to bypass the need to long jump or wall kick. While the maximum speed of twirling is 31, Pannenkoek found a way to twirl faster than that. It is done by  not  steering Mario most of the time to conserve the high speed achieved by sliding down from the tiptop of the mountain, where it is reached by frame-walking. CCM 100 Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/jWjQ0Bwbbxk   By collecting the coins in the big slide (where there are 72 coins) and sliding down the outer slide of the mountain, Mario would gather enough coins to spawn the 100 coin star. Other challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected in isolation, with  Slip Slidin' Away  and  Big Penguin Race  requiring a clip with the baby penguin to enter the slide.  Snowman's Lost His Head  cannot be collected in a full-game run, since the red coin star must be completed first. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  Slip Slidin' Away ,  Frosty Slide for 8 Red Coins ,  Wall Kicks Will Work , and  100 Coins  can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge ,  Li'l Penguin Lost ,  Frosty Slide for 8 Red Coins ,  Snowman's Lost His Head , and  100 Coins  can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses.  Li'l Penguin Lost  requires leading the baby penguin to the vertical wind. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Slip Slidin' Away  and  Wall Kicks Will Work  can be collected. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: getting more coins than intended, reaching a  Parallel Universe  from both areas of the level, grabbing the second baby penguin without pressing B, and getting hurt by a penguin. Trivia Cool, Cool Mountain was the first main course to be completed entirely in 0 A presses, being completely solved in 2011.

Klepto does not hold a star, while there are no extra tornadoes in the course. Act 3: Tornadoes : Accessed by selecting Star 4 through Star 6. Extra tornadoes will appear in certain quicksand areas. Tips Star order may vary depending on preferences. What's important to know is that it's preferable to select stars 2 or 3 for 100 coin to avoid the tornadoes.

{"prompt": "Explain Interaction Type", "completion": "An  interaction type  is a property that all  objects  have. Most objects have exactly one interaction type, but some, such as particle effects and platforms, have zero. No object may have more than one, and if one is hacked to have more than one, it will  crash  the game as Mario thinks that he is interacting with two different objects, each with one interaction flag, and cannot find them. Interaction types are analogous to  action flags , but  interaction flags  are not, which can be a source of confusion.

This interaction first checks whether Mario is in a suitable state to grab the owl (fulfilled by several airborne states) and checks if the  global timer  has advanced more than 30 ticks since Mario last let go of Hoot. If both these conditions are met, Mario can grab onto Hoot. Note that since the global timer advances while the game is paused, it is possible to fulfill the second condition right after Mario lets go of Hoot by simply pausing the game for 30 frames. Since the Hoot interaction is the first interaction type internally, and is referenced by the  Beta Boo Key  and  Bowser  actors, it is possible that this interaction was repurposed from an earlier type of interaction that was used earlier in development. Grabbable The Grabbable interaction is used by objects which are grabbable, such as  Bob-ombs  and  cork boxes . This interaction has 5 subtypes: the grab Mario subtype which is used by  Chuckya  and  King Bob-omb  and also makes the object  heavy , the holdable NPC subtype which lets Mario drop the object gently with no forward velocity, the talking drop subtype which is used by grabbable NPCs that also talk to Mario so that Mario will drop them when their dialogue is finished, the kickable subtype for objects that can be kicked and the not grabbable which is used by  Heave-Ho  to prevent Mario from picking it up. For the grab to occur, Mario must not be kicking an object of the kickable subtype, the object must not have the not grabbable subtype, and the usual conditions for Mario to grab something must be met. If the object being interacted with is not  Bowser , the interaction is also set to push Mario 5 units away from the object when he grabs it. Door The Door interaction is used for  doors  and has a subtype used for Star Doors. When Mario interacts with a door, the game checks to make sure he is  walking  or  decelerating  before checking if he has enough  stars  to open it. If these conditions are met, the game initializes variables for whether to push or pull the door open and a variable for the door\u2019s flag in the save file. If the door Mario interacts with is a regular door, then at this point Mario will either push or pull the door open. If the door Mario interacts with is a star door, a separate check is done and  a different action  is done for Mario to enter the star door. If the door requires stars to open, the game also runs a check for whether or not the door has been opened before in the save file. If it has not, the game runs an action where Mario uses the power of the stars to open the door. If Mario does not have the required stars, the game displays dialogue dependent on how many stars are required to open the door. In the case where the door requires 70 stars to open (in the game, the  Endless Stairs  star door), the game displays dialogue and then allows Mario to open the door. Hurtbox 1 & 2 Hurtbox 1 & 2 are identical with their behavior. If Mario makes contact with an object, it will simply  knock him back  and generally hurt him. Some examples include  Chain Chomp ,  Mr. Blizzard , and  Bullet Bills . The only distinction between the two is solely based on what file they are in. Coin This interaction is used for collecting  coins , as the name implies. When the interaction occurs, the number of coins Mario has is increased by the value of the coin, his heal counter is increased by 4 times the value of the coin, and the coin\u2019s interaction status is updated to mark that an interaction has occurred. If the course is a main course, the number of coins Mario has minus the value of the coin is less than 100, and Mario has at least 100 coins, the  100 Coin Star  spawns. Cap This interaction is used for when Mario picks up  caps . When the interaction occurs, the game gets Mario\u2019s current cap status, and initializes two variables for the cap timer and cap music. If Mario is not currently being  blown  away and Mario is wearing some kind of cap already, the game sets Mario\u2019s interacted object variable to the object and sets the object\u2019s interaction attribute to reflect that it has been interacted with. If the object is a  Vanish Cap , the cap\u2019s timer is set to 600 and the music is set to the Wing Cap music. If the cap is a  Metal Cap , the cap\u2019s timer is set to 600 and the music is set to the Metal Cap music. If the cap is a  Wing Cap , the cap\u2019s timer is set to 1800 and the music is set to the Wing Cap music. If the cap timer from the cap just collected is greater than Mario\u2019s current cap timer, Mario\u2019s cap timer is set to the collected object\u2019s cap timer. If Mario is  idle  or  walking , Mario  puts the cap on . Otherwise, Mario\u2019s flags are updated to have a cap on his head directly. Then, two sounds play and if the cap music is not set to 0, the cap music plays.  Pole This interaction is used for things Mario can  climb  i.e.  poles . When the interaction occurs, the game gets Mario\u2019s action and checks if it is a suitable action for pole climbing. If it is, the game checks if Mario is not already on a pole or if Mario\u2019s used object attribute is not set to the object he is interacting with. If the condition is met, the game sets a variable that tells whether or not Mario\u2019s forward  speed  is below 10, makes Mario stop riding or holding any object, set\u2019s Mario\u2019s interacted object and used object attributes to the object, sets Mario\u2019s forward and vertical velocities to 0, and sets several attributes regarding Mario and the pole. If Mario\u2019s speed is below 10, Mario grabs the pole slowly. Otherwise, Mario\u2019s pole yaw velocity is set to his forward velocity times 1.4 degrees plus 22.5 degrees, his pitch is reset, and his action is set to grabbing the pole quickly. Koopa Same as  Bounce Top . Spiny Used for the  Spiny  when it is walking around. When the interaction occurs, the game checks which interaction occurred between Mario and the object. If the interaction was a  punch , then the object has several variables updated and Mario is bounced back. Otherwise, if the interaction would cause Mario to be knocked back and take damage, it does so. If the object has the subtype that it delays the invincibility timer, it does so. Breakable Block This interaction is used for breakable objects such as  boxes . When the interaction occurs, the game checks to see which interaction occurred between Mario and the object. If the interaction was an attack, the game sets the object\u2019s interaction status to the attack and determines how Mario should bounce back from the attack. If Mario is in the air, his forward  speed  is set to -16 units/frame. If Mario is not in the air his forward speed is set to -48 units/frame. In the case where Mario hits the object from above, Mario is sent upwards with a Y-velocity of 30 units/frame. In the case where Mario hits the object from below, Mario\u2019s Y-velocity is set to 0 units/frame. Wind Used for when Mario is blown upward by strong  wind . When the interaction occurs, the game checks Mario\u2019s action to see if he is already blowing in the wind. If he is not, then Mario stops riding or holding any objects, Mario\u2019s facing  angle  is set to the wind\u2019s movement angle plus 180 degrees, his forward velocity is set to -24 units/frame, and his vertical velocity is set to 12 units/frame. A sound also plays, the  camera  is updated, and Mario\u2019s action is updated to reflect that he is  blowing in the wind . Warp Door Used for doors that take Mario to another  area , like the doors to the basement and upstairs of the castle. When the interaction occurs, the game checks whether Mario is either  walking  or  decelerating . If he is not, no further action is taken, if he is, the game proceeds with the rest of the interaction. If the door is the door to upstairs or door to the basement and Mario has not already unlocked it, the game checks if he has the right  key  for it. If he does not, the game displays text. If he does, Mario unlocks the door. If the door is not a locked door, the game decides whether Mario should push or pull the door open and then sends him through the warp.   Star/Key This interaction is used when Mario collects a  star  or a  key . The interaction has two subtypes: the no exit subtype and the  grand star  subtype. When the interaction occurs, the action Mario is to perform is set to a  star dance  with an exit afterwards. Two variables are also set to check whether the object being interacted with has the no exit or grand star subtype. If Mario\u2019s  health  is at least 256, meaning that Mario is not dead, then Mario stops riding or holding any objects and then the game runs several checks to determine what animation to play. If the object is not of the type no exit, Mario\u2019s hurt and heal counters are set to 0 and his cap timer is set to equal 1 if it is greater than 1. If the object is of the type no exit then the action Mario will perform is set to a star dance with no exit. If Mario is  swimming  or is wearing the  Metal Cap  underwater, then the action to be performed is set to the underwater star dance. If Mario is in the air the action is for Mario to fall and then do a star dance. After these checks, the game spawns a  smoke puff , updates the object to reflect that it has been interacted with, and sets Mario\u2019s interacted object and used object attributes to the object. Then, the game checks the object\u2019s star index and updates Mario\u2019s star count, if applicable. If the object is not of the no exit subtype, the level music is set to fade out. If the object is the Grand Star, Mario\u2019s action is set to begin the Grand Star collection cutscene. Otherwise, Mario\u2019s action is set to whatever action he was set to perform when the game checked each case. Warp Used for fade in  warps  and  pipes . When the interaction occurs, the game checks whether it is a fade warp or a pipe warp. If it is a fade warp, the game checks whether or not Mario has just faded in from the  teleport . If he has not, and if he is  idling ,  panting ,  standing against a wall , or  crouching , Mario is teleported via a fade out. If the warp is a pipe, and if Mario has not just emerged from the pipe, a sound plays, Mario stops holding or riding any objects, and Mario is warped via the pipe. Cannon Base This interaction is used for Mario entering a  cannon . When the interaction occurs, the game first checks to see if Mario is not already in a cannon. If he is not, Mario stops riding or holding any objects, the object is updated to reflect that it has been interacted with, Mario\u2019s interacted object and used object attributes are set to the object, and Mario\u2019s action is set so that he is in a cannon. Bounce Top Bounce top is used for objects Mario can bounce off of such as  Goombas . When an interaction between Mario and the object occurs, the game initializes a variable to store what kind of interaction occurred between Mario and the object. If Mario is wearing a metal cap, the variable is set to that of a fast attack. Otherwise, the game checks what sort of interaction occurred and sets the variable to that interaction. If the interaction is an attack, the game checks what kind of attack occurred, checks whether or not Mario should be bounced back from the attack, and then does further actions if the attack was Mario hitting the object from above. If Mario hit the object from above and the object is set to cause Mario to  twirl , Mario\u2019s vertical speed is set to 80, hit Y-position is set to be above the object\u2019s  hitbox , and his action is set to twirling. If Mario hit the object from above and the object is not set to make Mario twirl, Mario\u2019s vertical speed is set to 30 and his Y-position is set to be above the object\u2019s hitbox. If the interaction between Mario and the object was not an attack, then if the object is set to damage Mario and cause  knockback , it does so. If the object\u2019s interaction subtype is set to delay Mario\u2019s  invincibility  timer going down while the interaction is occurring, it does so. Water Ring This interaction is used by  water rings  like those spawned by the  Manta Ray  in  Dire, Dire Docks  and  Bubbles  in Dire, Dire Docks and  Jolly Roger Bay . When the interaction occurs, Mario\u2019s heal counter is increased by 4 times the object\u2019s \u201ccoin\u201d value and the object\u2019s interaction status is updated to mark that an interaction has occurred. Bully Used for  Bully  enemies. When the interaction occurs, the game checks for which interaction occurred between Mario and the object. If the interaction was Mario attacking the object, then Mario is pushed 5 units away from the object, his  forward velocity  is set to -16 units/frame, the object\u2019s moving  angle  is set to Mario\u2019s current facing angle, and the object\u2019s forward velocity is set to 3392 divided by the radius of the object\u2019s  hitbox . Otherwise, if Mario is not invulnerable or wearing the vanish cap, Mario\u2019s invincibility timer is set to 2, a sound plays, and Mario is knocked back by the object. Burns Used for objects that set Mario on  fire . If Mario is not invulnerable, not wearing a  Metal Cap , not wearing a  Vanish Cap , and not interacting with an object that delays the invincibility timer, the interaction proceeds. If Mario is  swimming  or if the distance between the  water level  at Mario\u2019s current position and Mario\u2019s current Y-position is greater than 50 (Mario is more than 50 units below the water level), a sound plays for putting a flame out. Otherwise, Mario\u2019s burn timer is set to 0, the camera is updated, and a sound plays for Mario being set on fire. If Mario is in the air with a vertical speed less than or equal to 0, Mario\u2019s action while burning is a burning fall. Otherwise, the action is a burning jump.  Koopa Shell This interaction is used for the  Koopa Shell  Mario can  ride . When the interaction occurs, first the game checks whether or not Mario is already riding a shell. If he is not, the game runs a function to determine what interaction occurred between Mario and the object. If the interaction with the object is Mario hitting it from above, or if Mario\u2019s action is set to walking, Mario\u2019s interactObj, usedObj, and riddenObj attritubes are set to the object, the game updates Mario\u2019s sound and camera to reflect him riding the shell, the shell music begins, Mario drops any held objects, and Mario\u2019s action is set to riding the shell. Bounce Top/Bottom Used for enemies Mario can kill from below. When the interaction occurs, the game checks for which interaction occurred between Mario and the object. If the interaction was an attack by Mario, the object is bounced back. If the attack was from below, Mario\u2019s  vertical speed  is set to 0. If the attack was from above, Mario bounces off the object either by twirling or by a regular bounce. Otherwise, if the interaction results in Mario taking  knockback  and damage, this occurs. If the interaction can freeze the invincibility countdown timer, it does so. Text This interaction is used for objects that display text when Mario interacts with them. When the interaction occurs, the game determines which interaction subtype it is. If the interaction has the  sign  subtype, the game returns a function for Mario to read the sign. If the interaction subtype is the NPC subtype, the game returns a function for Mario to talk to the NPC. Otherwise, the game pushes Mario 2 units away from the object.  Tornado This interaction is used for the  tornadoes  in  Shifting Sand Land . When the interaction occurs, the game checks to see if Mario is in the tornado  twirling  action or is  squished . If Mario is not in either of this states, Mario stops riding anything or holding anything if he is doing either of those things, his forward velocity is set to 0, a sound effect plays and Mario\u2019s action is set to the tornado twirling action. Whirlpool This interaction is used for the  Whirlpool  in  Dire, Dire Docks . When the interaction occurs, the game checks if Mario is already in the caught in whirlpool action. If Mario is not, Mario stops riding any object or holding any object if he is doing either of those things. Then, Mario\u2019s forward velocity is set to 0, a sound effect plays, and Mario\u2019s action is set to the caught in whirlpool action. Clam/Bubba This interaction is used for  Clams ,  Unagi , and  Bubba  and has a subtype for if the object can eat Mario. When the interaction occurs, if the interaction has the can eat Mario subtype, Mario is  eaten . Otherwise if Mario is in a state to take damage and  knockback , he does so. If the object has the subtype that it delays the invincibility timer, it does so. BBH Entrance This interaction is used for the  cage  Mario jumps into to enter  Big Boo's Haunt . When the interaction occurs, first the game checks to see if Mario is already in the act of  entering BBH . If he is not, Mario stops riding or holding any objects, the object is updated to reflect that it has been interacted with, and Mario\u2019s interacted object and used object attributes are set to the object. The game then sets Mario\u2019s action depending on whether or not he is in the air. If Mario is in the air, Mario\u2019s action is set so that he will spin into the BBH cage. If Mario is not in the air, his action is set so that he will jump into the BBH cage. Snufit Bullet Used for the  Snufit   bullet . When the interaction occurs, the game checks that Mario is not invulnerable or wearing a  Vanish Cap . If he is not but he is wearing a  Metal Cap , Mario takes no damage and the sound of the bullets bouncing off him plays. Otherwise, Mario takes damage without knockback, a sound plays, and his action is set based on what knockback the game determines Mario should take from the damage. Shocks Used for electrical interactions with  amps . When the interaction occurs, the game checks that Mario is not invulnerable or wearing a vanish cap. If he is not, Mario takes damage without knockback and a sound plays. Then, the game checks if Mario is swimming or walking underwater. If he is, Mario is set to his  underwater shock  action. Otherwise, he does his regular shock action. If the object can freeze the invincibility countdown timer, it does so. Igloo Barrier This article is a  stub . As such, it is not complete. You can help Ukikipedia by  expanding it . This interaction is used for the  Igloo Barrier  object in Snowman\u2019s Land. When the interaction occurs, the game runs a function that pushes Mario away from the object. Unusually, this interaction sets Mario\u2019s used object attribute without updating his action, unlike every other interaction in the game. This has the potential to cause several glitches, but these cannot be performed in regular circumstances since the Igloo Barrier is the only object to use this interaction. Special Cases A few objects can switch from their default interaction types in certain circumstances, mostly between hurtbox and another type. King Bob-omb King Bob-omb  normally uses the Grabbable interaction type. However, after King Bob-omb is thrown onto the ground, his interaction type is changed to Hurtbox until he gets back up. This is done to prevent Mario from picking up King Bob-omb immediately after throwing him. Bowser Bowser's  body's interaction type is normally Hurtbox. However, when Bowser is defeated, his body's interaction type is changed to Text. Spinies When  Spiny  is walking around, its interaction type is the Spiny type. However, if Spiny is not walking around or has just been hit by Mario, it is set to the hurtbox interaction type.  Piranha Plant When a Piranha Plant is sleeping, its interaction type is Bounce Top. When it is biting, its interaction type is Hurtbox. References Decomp File"}

Position Most stars spawn with coordinates that are divisible by 100, although 100 Coin Stars can spawn anywhere. Some stars are always loaded, while some (such as  Red Coin Stars  and  Secret Stars ) load during the level at a  Star Spawner . Yaw Velocity (Angular Speed) Power Stars spawned from a  ! Block  have a yaw velocity of 1024  angle units  per  frame  (168.75 deg/s). All other Power Stars have a yaw velocity of 2048 angle units per frame (337.5 deg/s). This is because the Power Stars have different behaviors. All Power Stars spin counterclockwise when viewed from above, similarly to a globe. Storage in memory This article is a  stub . As such, it is not complete. You can help Ukikipedia by  expanding it . Power Stars are stored such that it is impossible to collect more than 120 stars by collecting two of the same star, even if both are yellow.

This page is most likely lacking information or may contain inaccuracies.  You can help fix it . The  discussion page  may contain suggestions. Chuckya Wrong Throw  is a glitch that exploits  Chuckya 's anchor point(AP). This works similarly to Mario's  HOLP . When Chuckya throws Mario, the latter appears at the anchor point. The anchor point is initialized to Chuckya's position on level load and is updated whenever Chuckya is rendered. This behavior can be exploited by being grabbed by Chuckya when he is not rendered, for example by using  BCA , this will cause Mario to be thrown at the anchor point instead of Chuckya's real position King Bob-omb  also uses the same mechanic, but it is limited by its behavior and the camera in its fight, making it unusable in vanilla By throwing Chuckya to a remote HOLP, moving the camera away, and getting grabbed by that same Chuckya, it's possible to effectively teleport to the HOLP. This trick was used by multiple times by Marbler in BitS to reach a HOLP, saving a lot of time over the past strategies.

Keep in mind that if there are any blue stars (uncollected) present in the star selection menu, then the last version that can be selected is the first blue star and not the stars after it: Version 1 : Accessed by selecting Star 1. The manta ray is not present. Version 2 : Accessed by selecting Star 2 through Star 6. The manta ray will appear. Additionally, Bowser's submarine and the hatch cover will disappear after Bowser in the Fire Sea is completed, replaced by several moving poles across the ceiling of the course. Coins This stage has natural maximum of 106 coins, although this can be extended. Coin spawner cloning via the loading zone using a water shell allows infinite collection of coins in this course.

Entering Dire Dire Docks  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/mlHzqJn2SMs?t=2m24s   Since the painting is very large, walking into it will suffice and it is not required to dive. Board Bowser's Sub  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/4JEoBwuXkzQ   The main problem is ascending to Bowser's submarine since Mario cannot climb up to it from the water. However, a technique known as  207 Dive Recover  can be used to ascend from the cork boxes using the  misalignment , a 1-unit region where Mario cannot be pushed out by the walls and can snap onto the floor above. Using this technique, Mario can board Bowser's sub and collect the star. Chests in the Current  (0x) Video 1 (main strategy):  https://youtu.be/WXXR-cwhW9w   Video 2 (alternative, faster strat):  https://youtu.be/cTNlkmiGNRw   Mario can collect the star by opening the chest in the correct order. The main problem is opening the 4th chest, which is very close to the underwater vortex and can only be escaped with enough speed (10 using precise movements). Using underwater grabbing (with precise B presses), Mario can only go up to 7 speed, so Pannenkoek first grabs an underwater shell on the other side of the tunnel to conserve 16 speed, allowing Mario to escape the current when opening chests. Eventually, Pannekoek figures out an alternative, quicker method involving  Hyper Speed Walking  on the slippery slopes at the surface of the course, allowing Mario to build up to 50 speed and convert it to 11 swimming speed. This is barely enough to escape the vortex after the fourth chest is opened. Pole-Jumping for Red Coins  (0.5x) Main article:  Pole-Jumping for Red Coins Video:  https://youtu.be/gvQMNQlgu3s   The main challenge is collecting the two red coins behind the red walls and the one lone coin in the cage. The 0.5 A press is used for swimming in water with an object, as Mario needs to hold a shell through the loading zone. For the two coins behind the red walls, Mario clones a pole directly between two widely-separated poles for Mario to get across. For the caged red coin, the HOLP with a dummy clone at a specific location for cloning a whirlpool clone to exploit the \"no transition loading glitch\". The transition loading is a procedure the game uses to create an illusion for two connected areas. Normally, the loading point would translate Mario's position by 8192 units to fit in the new coordinates system of the new area, but a failsafe mechanism exists to reject the translation if Mario's new position would be out of bounds. By placing a whirlpool clone into a position out of bounds, Mario can avoid the loading point translation by being pulled by the whirlpool clone through the wall and triggering the loading point at the same frame. As the new area loads, Mario begins to spiral, not around the whirlpool, but the newly loaded cork box replacing the whirlpool clone. He is then able to escape from the whirlpool death as the spiraling path grazes on a platform Mario can stand on, conveniently close to where the caged red coin is. Through the Jet Stream  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/2kayePVdnw8   Previously, Pannenkoek uses 0.5 A presses (holding out the previous A) to collect the star by either cloning a pole to access the caps or use loading point cloning without the Metal Cap, as accessing the caps requires A presses to reach. However, the 207 dive recover strategy allowing ascending the cork boxes was soon discovered, allowing Mario to use the Metal Cap with 0 A presses. Mario simply swims through the 5 aqua rings and collect the star by using a metal cap. Unlike the star in Jolly Roger Bay, this star is close enough to the ground for Metal Mario to pick it up by walking into it underwater. The Manta Ray's Reward  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/EHcih_XvYTM   Due to low swimming speed without A presses, Mario has to preemptively go in front of the manta ray and follow the rings. Other than that, the stage is simple to complete. Collect the Caps\u2026  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/pYTzVFC0Qoo   Mario needs to use the 207 dive recover trick twice, first to collect the vanish cap, and then collect the metal cap. Mario would then have enough speed to drop down into the water while retaining invisibility to enter the cage. Mario then swims upwards to collect the star. This takes the advantage from the fact that the vanish cap timer (20 seconds) resets while grabbing the metal cap, allowing the vanish cap to last long enough. DDD 100 coins  (0.5x) Video:  https://youtu.be/vkHU_IFmvoQ   As the coin count of the course is 106, 30 of which is from the blue coin block inaccessible without A presses and 16 of which is from red coins, there are only 60 yellow coins that can be collected. Fortunately, there are many coin spawners of 8 that Mario can use to clone since there is a loading point in the course. Therefore, Mario can get infinite coins by \"coin spawner cloning\". The process is estimated to take 25 minutes. Since cloning is involved, Mario needs to hold down A in order to swim with an object held. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge , where  Collect the Caps...  must be cloned with the water shell, and  Through the Jet Stream  requires efficient swimming. In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected, as they all require swimming. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected, as Mario cannot turn in the water. Note that when entering the level, Mario's angle doesn't face the tunnel. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses.  100 Coins  requires coin spawner cloning to avoid ground pounding the  Blue Coin  block. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Board Bowser's Sub ,  Chests in the Current , and  Collect the Caps...  can be collected. The latter requires  Hyperspeed Wall Kicking  to go behind the wall. In the  Floor is Lava Challenge , every star except for  100 Coins  can be collected, as Mario starts the level in the water.  100 Coins  is impossible because it either requires ground pounding the Blue Coin block and landing on the ground, or using coin spawner cloning, which requires walking out of the water. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to reach a  Parallel Universe  in the starting area.

It can connect to a running emulator and update values in real time. Some core features include views of loaded/unloaded objects, Mario structure variables,  camera  +  HUD  values, an overhead map display, and many more. An up-to-date version of STROOP can be downloaded from  here .

Pannenkoek2012 discussed this desire with Tyler Kehne. Tyler then proceeded to make a ROM hack that could display the object slot behaviors in text form, overlaid onto the screen. Pannenkoek2012 was not pleased with this implementation, as he wanted a separate program that would show the slots visually with images of the objects. Thus, Tyler then proceeded to make a program that would do just that, which he named the SM64 Diagnostic. Tyler wrote the code for it, and Pannenkoek2012 provided the  object  images and names. The SM64 Diagnostic was a major breakthrough, as it showed the object slots, the process groups, the held object, object variables, and Mario variables. However, it also had some annoyances, such as it couldn't connect to an already open Mupen (it had to open Mupen itself), it would occasionally crash Mupen, the  angle  variables (yaw/pitch/roll) had confusing names, the variables couldn't be edited, and the checkbox variables used a confusing system. Some time later, Dane Bouchie created a new program called STROOP, which was based on the SM64 Diagnostic, but with many more features and improved functionality. Later, Pannenkoek2012 also began coding for STROOP, adding even more features and functionality. As of today, STROOP has object slots, object variables, Mario variables,  HUD  variables, camera variables, triangle variables, water variables, an input display, a file display, a map that can display objects in real time, an M64 editor, and savable options so that the user can customize their experience. Loading Screen   STROOP Loading Screen When first opening STROOP, you'll be greeted with a loading screen. This displays what is currently being initialized, as well as a random helpful hint. You can right click the text field and a context menu will appear. Upon clicking it, a list of all helpful hints will appear. Connection Screen   STROOP Connection Screen After STROOP finishes loading, you'll encounter a screen where you can choose what process or savestate to connect to. There are various buttons to use: Refresh : Refreshes the list of processes to choose from. Connect : Connects STROOP to the currently selected process. Bypass : Bypasses the start screen. Note that most functionality won't work if you press this, as most functionality relies on having a data stream to interact with. But this could be useful if you only want to use the M64 editor, for example. Refresh & Connect : Refreshes the list of processes to choose from, and then connects STROOP to the currently selected process. This can save a button press in the case that you need to press both Refresh and Connect. Open Savestate : Connects STROOP to a savestate, chosen from the File Manager. This can be useful if you want to modify values in a savestate, such as global timer or RNG. If you've edited a savestate and want to save it, then right click on the Disconnect button on the top left of STROOP, and you'll see an option to save the savestate. Top-Level Controls On the top of STROOP are several controls that may be of use. These are: Disconnect Button : Disconnects from the current process or savestate. Right click on this for the option to save a savestate after it's been modified. FPS Counter : Displays the number of frames per second that STROOP is running at. By default, STROOP aims for 30 FPS. However, this can be changed in the Options tab. Connected To : Displays the process that STROOP is currently connected to. Left/Right Arrow Buttons : These can be used to reorder tabs. Simply click on one of the arrow buttons and the currently selected tab will move one spot over in that direction. Right click on these buttons for an option to restore the tabs to the recommended tab order. Separately, you can click on the arrow buttons while holding control, and this will move the currently selected object slots over one spot in that direction. Furthermore, you can click on the arrow buttons while holding a number n, and this will move the currently selected object slots over n spots in that direction. Add Tab Button : Click on this button to see a list of tabs that have been hidden. Click on one of these tabs to restore that tab. Alternatively, click on \"Restore All Tabs\" to restore all of the tabs. ROM Version : This displays the ROM version that STROOP is currently operating under. By default, it tries to auto-detect what ROM version is being used. However, if you want to use a specific ROM version instead of the auto-detected one, then choose one of the ROM version options without the \"AUTO\" prefix. ReadWrite/ReadOnly Mode : This displays whether STROOP is is ReadWrite mode or ReadOnly mode. By default, it will be in ReadWrite mode, allowing the user to modify variables. In ReadOnly mode, modifying variables won't work. Panel Hide/Show Buttons : These 6 buttons allow you to adjust which panels are hidden/shown in any tab of STROOP. In order from left to right, these are: Left Only, Left + Right, Right Only, Bottom Only, Bottom + Top, Top Only. By default, these buttons will only affect the outermost panels. However, for situations where there are nested panels (e.g. the Memory Tab), you can control which set of panels is being targeted by holding down a number key. Specifically, holding down the number n will target the nth set of panels, where panels are indexed from outermost to innermost. Thus, holding down the number 1 is equivalent to not holding down any number, since it automatically targets the outermost pair of panels. Holding down 2 or higher will affect other panels, assuming they're on screen. Cog : The cog can be used to quickly and easily toggle savable options, to reset saved options, or to go directly to the Options tab. For more information about the savable options, see the Options Tab section. Version Number : This displays the current version number of STROOP. Right clicking on this provides debugging/developer options, most of which aren't intended for the casual user. Nevertheless, some useful options include: Enable  TASer  Settings : Switches to the TAS tab, hides the left panel, filters variables to show only the TAS variables, and enables the STROOP ROM hack. This setting was created for Plush's convenience. Show MHS Vars : Opens a Pop Out with variables commonly found in MHS. This is a convenience for users that are used to using MHS. Download Latest STROOP Release : Downloads the latest STROOP release. This downloads as a separate file, instead of replacing the currently-being-used STROOP file. Show All Helpful Hints : Shows a list of all helpful hints from the loading screen. Show Skribblio Words : Shows a list of all Skribbl.io words in a randomized order. Tabs STROOP has several tabs, each of which manages one specific domain. For example, there's a Mario tab, Triangles tab, M64 tab, Map tab, etc. In fact, there are so many tabs that it's recommended that you customize which tabs are shown and their order, for your own convenience. To reorder tabs, use the left/right arrow buttons on the top right of STROOP, which will move the current tab one space over in the arrow's direction. To hide a tab, click on the tab while holding control. Using these 2 techniques, you should be able to reduce the number of tabs to a reasonable amount as well as put the tabs in the order most convenient to you. If you ever need to use a tab that you've hidden, then simply add it back using the Add Tab button on the top right of STROOP. Note that the order of tabs and which tabs are hidden are saved, so you only need to do this once, as these settings will stay the same on subsequent STROOP opens. However, if you ever download a new version of STROOP, the settings will be back to their original state. Nevertheless, you can always copy the saved settings file (STROOP\\Config\\SavedSettings.xml) from the older version of STROOP and replace that corresponding file in the newer version of STROOP. <tabber> Object= |-| Mario= |-| HUD= |-| Camera= |-| Triangles= |-| File= |-| M64= |-| Actions= |-| Input= |-| Water= |-| Misc= |-| Custom= |-| TAS= |-| Map= |-| Map2= |-| Options= |-| Memory= |-| PU= |-| Area= |-| Model= |-| Gfx= |-| Debug= |-| Hacks= |-| Cam Hack= |-| Q Frames= |-| Var Hack= |-| Disassembly= |-| Decompiler= |-| Scripts= |-| Coin= |-| Snow= |-| Main Save= |-| Testing= |-| Painting= |-| </tabber> Object Slot Panel The lower half of STROOP is the  Object Slot  Panel. This shows all 240 object slots in the game. There are various controls to use at the top of the panel: Lock Labels Checkbox : This locks the labels on the slots so that they'll no longer change. The labels will also turn blue to indicate that they are no longer changing. This can be useful if you want to see how the object slots change from one point in time to another, as you can know what positions the slots used to be in. Slot Size Slider : This controls the size of the object slots. Label Method : This controls what label method is used to determine the label for the object slots. Recommended : This uses the recommended label method for the current Sort Method. Specifically, it will use SlotPosVs for ProcessingOrder, SlotIndex for MemoryOrder, and SlotPosVs for DistanceToMario. SlotPosVs : Loaded object slots will use their processing index, and unloaded object slots will use their processing index prefixed with \"VS\". SlotPos : Loaded object slots will use their processing index, and unloaded object slots will continue the indexing from where the loaded slots left off. SlotIndex : Object slots will use their memory index. Sort Method : This controls how the object slots are sorted. ProcessingOrder : The object slots are sorted by their processing order. In other words, the loaded object slots are in the order by which they are processed (i.e. updated), and the unloaded object slots are in the order by which they would take on more objects. MemoryOrder : The object slots are sorted by their memory order. In other words, they are sorted by the memory addresses of the object structs that each object slot represents. DistanceToMario : The object slots are sorted by their distance to Mario, from closest to farthest. Note that the loaded object slots are presented first, then followed by the unloaded object slots. You can also right click on the Object Slot Panel for the option to select the object slot corresponding to the value that you've copied (i.e. what's on the clipboard). Object Slots The object slots are found in the Object Slot Panel. An object slot has 4 parts to it: an image, a label, a background color, and zero or more overlays.  Image : The image shows what object is represented by the object slot. The image is transparent when the object is unloaded or set to be unloaded. Label : The label represents the index of the slot by some indexing system (see Label Method under Object Slot Panel). Background Color : The background color represents what Process Group the object belongs to. Process Group 0x0B (Spawner) is Pink Process Group 0x09 (Surface) is Red Process Group 0x0A (Usable) is Red-Orange Process Group 0x00 (Player) is Orange Process Group 0x05 (Pushable) is Yellow Process Group 0x04 (Actor) is Green Process Group 0x02 (Respawning) is Light Blue Process Group 0x06 (Level) is Dark Blue Process Group 0x08 (Default) is Purple Process Group 0x0C (Unimportant) is Brown Vacant Group is Grey   The object slot overlays Overlays : The overlays are images overlaid onto certain object slots to provide additional information. The object slots are as follows: Selected : The object(s) selected in the Object Tab. Map : The object(s) that are shown on the map in the Map Tab and Map2 Tab. Map Home : The object(s) whose home(s) are shown on the map in the Map2 Tab. Model : The object that's shown in the Model Tab. Marked : The object(s) that are marked. Click on an object slot while holding Alt to mark it. Closest : The loaded object that's closest to Mario. Held : The object that Mario's holding. Stood On : The object that Mario's standing on. Interaction : The object that Mario's interacting with. Used : The object that Mario's using. Ridden : The object that Mario's riding on. Camera : The secondary object that the camera is set to focus on. Camera Hack : The object that is being focused on using the Camera Hack. Floor : The object that Mario's  floor  triangle belongs to. Wall : The object that Mario's  wall  triangle belongs to. Ceiling : The object that Mario's  ceiling  triangle belongs to. Parent : The parent of the currently hovered object. Parent Unused : The currently hovered object when the currently hovered object's parent is the unused slot. Parent None : The currently hovered object when the currently hovered object has no parent. Child : A child of the currently hovered object. Collision 1 : The 1st collision object of the Mario object. Collision 2 : The 2nd collision object of the Mario object. Collision 3 : The 3rd collision object of the Mario object. Collision 4 : The 4th collision object of the Mario object. Some additional notes on the overlays: Which overlays are displayed can be changed in the Options tab. By default, all overlays are displayed except for Parent and Child ones, as these are the only ones dependent on the currently hovered object. Nevertheless, there's a shortcut to quickly and temporarily see an object's parent/child, which is to hold down P while hovering over an object slot. By default, the collision objects are in reference to the Mario object. However, if you want to see the collision objects for a different object, then simply hold down C while hovering over that object's slot. The Selected, Map, Map Home, Marked, Model, and Camera Hack overlays represent overlays that the user can modify themselves by clicking on the object slots when under certain circumstances. For some of these, multi-selection is available, meaning that multiple slots can be selected at the same time. In these cases, the shortcut of holding shift can be used to select the range of object slots between the previously selected object slot and the currently selected object slot. When multi-selection is available, there's also the concept of toggle-ability, explained as follows. In some cases (e.g. Selected), clicking on an object slot will select that object slot and unselect all other object slots. In these cases, holding control will make it so that clicking on an object slot will toggle that slot's selectedness while leaving all other slots' selectednesses unchanged. In other cases (e.g. Map, Marked), the situation is reversed. That is, clicking on an object slot will toggle that slot's selectedness while leaving all other slots' selectednesses unchanged, whereas holding control will make it so that clicking on an object slot will select that object slot and unselect all other object slots. We say that these cases are toggle-able by default. In both situations, holding control will toggle whether we're in toggle-mode or not, but it's just that the default mode may or may not be toggle-able. Here is more information: Selected : Modifiable when clicking on an object slot. Multi-selection allowed. Map : Modifiable when clicking on an object slot in the Map Tab or Map2 Tab. Multi-selection allowed. Toggle-able by default. Map Home : Modifiable when clicking on an object slot in the Map2 Tab with H held. Multi-selection allowed. Toggle-able by default. Model : Modifiable when clicking on an object slot in the Model Tab. Marked : Modifiable when clicking on an object slot with Alt held. Multi-selection allowed. Toggle-able by default. Camera Hack : Modifiable when clicking on an object slot in the Cam Hack Tab. You can right click on an object slot for even more options. Note that the option will by default only affect the object slot that was right clicked on. If instead you want to have the option affect all slots that are selected, then click the option while holding control. The options are as follows: Select in Object Tab : Selects the object slot in the Object Tab, and switches to the Object Tab. Select in Memory Tab : Selects the object slot in the Memory Tab, and switches to the Memory Tab. Go to : Sends Mario to the object, offset by the \"Go to offset\" in the Options Tab. Retrieve : Sends the object to Mario, offset by the \"Retrieve offset\" in the Options Tab. Go to Home : Sends Mario to the object's home, offset by the \"Go to offset\" in the Options Tab. Retrieve Home : Sends the object's home to Mario, offset by the \"Retrieve offset\" in the Options Tab. Release : Releases the object by settings its Release Status. This is identical to releasing a clone of an object that isn't meant to be released. UnRelease : Undoes the releasing of an object. Interact : Interacts with an object by setting its Interaction Status to 0xFFFFFFFF. This can be useful if you don't want to interact with a  clone , e.g. making a fire clone inert. UnInteract : Undoes the interacting of an object by setting its Interaction Status to 0x00000000. Clone : Clones the object into Mario's hands. UnClone : Undoes the cloning of the object by clearing what's in Mario's hands. This doesn't actually release the object. Unload : Sets the object to be unloaded. Revive : Revives an unloaded object into a loaded state. Ride : Has Mario ride on the object. Specifically, sets Mario's ridden object to that object and puts Mario into a riding state. UnRide : Undoes the riding of an object. Ukikipedia : Opens up the Ukikipedia page for an object. Copy Address : Copies the object's address to the clipboard. Copy Position : Copies the object's position to the clipboard. Paste Position : Pastes the clipboard data onto an object's position. Copy Graphics : Copies the object's graphics value to the clipboard. Paste Graphics : Pastes the clipboard data onto an object's graphics value. Copy Object : Copies the object's bytes to a custom clipboard in STROOP. Paste Object : Pastes STROOP's custom clipboard data onto the object. Note that this doesn't overwrite the object's next/previous memory/processed object slots references, since that would corrupt the linked list structure. Variable Panel Variables Variables are found in a Variable Panel. A variable has 2 parts to it: a name (on the left) and a value (on the right). On every STROOP update, the value updates. You can set a variable's value by double clicking on the value, entering text, and then pressing enter. Some variables are values in memory, while other variables are calculated manually (referred to as special variables). While memory variables can always be set, special variables may or may not be able to be set. If you try to set a variable and it doesn't go through (either because the variable can't be set or because you entered an illegal value), then the variable will flash red to indicate this. All variables come with the following options when right clicked: Highlight : Highlights the variable by giving it a red outline. Lock : Locks the variable's value. Note that the variable's value can still be edited while it's locked. Copy : Copies the variable's value (with no rounding) to the clipboard. Paste : Pastes the clipboard value to the variable. Panel Options : Opens up the Variable Panel options. Open Controller : Opens up an Advanced Controller for the variable. Add to Custom Tab : Adds the variable to the Custom Tab. Fix Address : Fixes the address of the variable. Rename : Allows you to rename the variable. Remove : Removes the variable from the Variable Panel. Number variables come with the following additional options when right clicked: Round to ... : Sets how many digits to round the variable to. Display as Hex : Toggles whether the variable is displayed as hex or decimal. Angle variables come with the following additional options when right clicked: Signed : Toggles whether the variable is displayed as signed or not. Units... : Sets the units for the angle variable. The unit options are: In-Game Units : These are the units that the game uses. One revolution is 65536 in-game units. HAU : Standing for hexadecimal angle units, these are in-game units divided by 16. Thus, one revolution is 4096 HAU. These are useful because angles that fall under the same HAU value use the same entry in the game's trig table, since angles are truncated to the closest multiple of 16 before accessing the table. Degrees : One revolution is 360 degrees. Radians : One revolution is 2*pi radians. Revolutions : One revolution is one revolution. Truncate to Multiple of 16 : Toggles whether the angle's value is truncated to a multiple of 16. This is useful since angles that truncated to same the closest multiple of 16 use the same entry in the game's trig table. Constrain to One Revolution : Toggles whether the angle's value is constrained to one revolution. For example, an angle that's unsigned and in angle units would be constrained to the range [0, 65535], whereas an angle that's signed and in angle units would be constrained to the range [-32768, 32767]. Reverse : Toggles whether the angle is displayed as the reverse of what it actually is. Address variables come with the following additional options when right clicked: View Address : Views the variable's value as an address in the Memory Tab. Object variables come with the following additional options when right clicked: Display as Object : Displays the variable's value as an Object. Values include: Slot n : The nth loaded slot. Slot VSn : The nth vacant slot. PG n : Process Group n's node. (none) : The value 0. (unused object) : The unused object slot. (unknown object) : A value that's not recognized as a valid object reference. Select Object : Selects the object slot whose object's address equals the variable's value. Triangle variables come with the following additional options when right clicked: Select Triangle : Selects a custom triangle in the Triangle Tab whose address equals the variable's value. Boolean variables are unique in that instead of having a text value, they have a checkbox value. The checkbox is checked if the underlying number value (after possibly masking) is non-zero. In the case that the variable represents multiple values with different checked states, the checkbox will be indeterminant. Boolean variables come with the following additional options when right clicked: Display as Checkbox : Toggles whether the variable is displayed as a checkbox. Display as Inverted : Toggles whether the checkbox's checked state is inverted. Variables can be selected by clicking on them. You can hold shift and click on a variable to select the range of variables from the previously selected variable to the currently selected variable. To toggle whether a variable is selected or not without unselecting all variable, click on the variable while holding control. To unselect all variables, click on the variable panel. If you right click on a variable that's selected, then you'll see a different set of options from normal, and these options will affect all selected variables. Options prefixed with \"Angle:\" only affect angles. Choosing the \"Default\" value for an option (e.g. Display as Hex) will set that option to how the variable was originally (e.g. its original status of whether it was displaying as hex). Here are these options: Highlight... : Highlights the variables with a red or custom-colored outline. Lock... : Locks the variables' values. Fix Address... : Fixes the addresses of the variables. Copy... : Copies the variable's value (with no rounding) to the clipboard. This can be done with commas, tabs, or line breaks separating the variable values. Separately, you can copy the variable values for code, which will copy instantiation statements for each of the variables, e.g. \"float X = 100f\". For more control over what the variables are named, hold control while clicking this option. This will open up a dialog where you can enter text, where the $ represents the variables' original names. For example, entering \"my$Value\" will result in \"float myXValue = 100f\" being copied to the clipboard. Paste : Pastes the clipboard value to the variables. The values for the variables will be parsed from the clipboard value, which will work so long as the values are separated by whitespace (e.g. spaces, tabs, line breaks) or commas. Round to... : Sets how many digits to round the variables to. Display as Hex... : Sets whether the variables are displayed as hex or decimal. Angle: Signed... : Sets whether the variables are displayed as signed or not. Angle: Units... : Sets the units for the angle variables. See above for more information on the unit options. Angle: Truncate to Multiple of 16... : Sets whether the angles' values are truncated to a multiple of 16. Angle: Constrain to One Revolution... : Sets whether the angles' values are constrained to one revolution. Angle: Reverse... : Sets whether the angles are displayed as the reverse of what it actually is. Angle: Display as Hex... : Sets whether the angle variables are displayed as hex or decimal. Show Variable XML : Shows the XML that represents the variables. Show Variable Info : Shows info on the variables in table form, including Name, Type, Base + Offset, N64 Address, and Emulator Address. Background Color... : Changes the variables background color. Move... : Options for moving variables. Start Move : Adds the selected variables to the moving-variables-clipboard. End Move : Moves the variables on the moving-variables-clipboard to the location of the selected variables. Clear Move : Clears the selected-variables-clipboard. Remove : Removes the variables from the Variable Panel. Rename : Allows you to rename the variables. This will open up a dialog where you can enter text, where the $ represents the variables' original names. For example, entering \"my$Value\" will result in renaming \"X\" to \"myXValue\". Open Controller : Opens up an Advanced Controller for the variables. Open Triplet Controller : Opens up a Triplet Controller for the variables. Open Pop Out : Opens up a Pop Out for the variables. Add to Tab... : Adds the variables to a tab of your choosing. Add to Custom Tab : Adds the variables to the Custom Tab. There are also many keyboard shortcuts that can be performed on variables, namely by clicking on a variable when holding one or more keys. These are: Double Click : Opens up the Variable Viewer form for the variable, which shows the variable's Name, Type, Base + Offset, N64 Address, and Emulator Address. Click + Shift + Number : Sets the variable's background color to different colors, depending on the number. Click + Number : Sets the variable's highlight color to different colors, depending on the number. Click + S : Adds the variable to the Custom Tab. Click + T : Adds the variable to the TAS Tab. Click + M : Adds the variable to the Memory Tab. Click + P : Adds the variable to a tab of your choosing. Click + N : Views the variable's value as an address in the Memory Tab. Click + F : Fixes the address of the variable. Click + H : Highlights the variable with a red outline. Click + L : Locks the variable's value. Click + D : Toggles whether the variable is displayed as hex or decimal. Click + R : Allows you to rename the variable. Click + C : Opens up an Advanced Controller for the variable. Click + B : Opens up an Bit Controller for the variable. Click + Escape : Removes the variable from the Variable Panel. Click + Backspace : Removes the variable from the Variable Panel. Click + Delete : Removes the variable from the Variable Panel. Click + X : Does an action related to moving a variable. Specifically: If the moving-variables-clipboard is empty, then adds the variable to the moving-variables-clipboard. If the moving-variables-clipboard is non-empty, then moves the variables of the moving-variables-clipboard to the clicked variable's current location. Click + Backtick : Adds the variable to the Var Hack tab. Click + Z : Sets the variable value to zero. Click + Minus : Decrements the variable value. Click + Plus : Increments the variable value. Click + Q : Sets the variable's background color to a custom color. Click + O : Sets the variable's background color to the last custom color. Controllers   The various kinds of controllers Controllers are a set of controls used for manipulating one or more variables. There are various kinds of controllers: Simple Controller : A Simple Controller is in charge of manipulating one variable. It consists of 2 buttons and a textbox. The buttons are used for subtracting from and adding to the variable using the value that's in the textbox. Right clicking on one of the buttons shows the option to toggle whether the buttons are inverted, i.e. swapping whether subtraction is on the left and addition is on the right or vice versa. Simple Controllers are found on the left panel of several tabs of STROOP. Triplet Controller : A Triplet Controller is in charge of manipulating a triplet of variables, usually a set of (x,y,z) Euler coordinates or (theta,phi,radius) spherical coordinates. It consists of 2 sets of controls: Square Controls : On the left are the Square Controls, consisting of 8 buttons and a textbox arranged in square formation. For Euler coordinates, these controls manipulate the x and z coordinates. For spherical coordinates, these controls manipulate the theta and phi coordinates. In both cases, the buttons will add to or subtract from the corresponding variable(s) by the amount in the textbox. Note that you can right click on the buttons for more options so that you can customize the orientation of the buttons. Specifically, this allows you to rotate the buttons any one of eight ways, as well as invert the orientation (i.e. flip it). Line Controls : One the right are the Line Controls, consisting of 2 buttons and a textbox arranged in a vertical line formation. For Euler coordinates, these controls manipulate the y coordinate. For spherical coordinates, these controls manipulate the radius coordinate. In both cases, the buttons will add to or subtract from the corresponding variable by the amount in the textbox. Note that you can right click on the buttons for options to invert the buttons. Triplet controllers also frequently have a Relative Checkbox in the upper right, which toggles whether the controls manipulate the variables absolutely or relative to some angle. When in relative mode, the labels on the buttons will change to emphasize this. Specifically, F = forward, B = backward, L = left, R = right, U = up, D = down. Triplet Controllers are found on the left panel of several tabs of STROOP. However, you can also create your own Triplet Controller by selecting 3 or 4 variables to represent the x,y,z and optional angle variables, right clicking, and choosing to open a Triplet Controller. Advanced Controller : An advanced controller is in charge of manipulating one or more variables. It consists of the following controls: Name Textbox : This shows the name(s) of the variable(s) being manipulated. Note that this can be edited. Fix Address Checkbox : This is used to toggle whether the variable(s) are using fixed addresses. Value Textbox : This displays the current value(s) of the variable(s). The background color is red if the variable(s) have fixed addresses, blue if the variable(s) don't have fixed addresses, and purple if some variables do and some variables don't have fixed addresses. Lock Checkbox : This is used to toggle whether the variable(s) are locked. Subtraction Button : This is used to subtract a value from the variable(s). Addition/Subtraction Textbox : This is the value that's used by the Addition Button and Subtraction Button. Addition Button : This is used to add a value to the variable(s). Get Button : This gets the value(s) of the variable(s). Get/Set Textbox : This is the value used by the Get Button and Set Button. Set Button : This sets the value(s) of the variable(s). Additional notes: In the case of setting multiple variables, you can set all of the variables to different values by separating the values in the textbox with commas. Alternatively, leave just one value in the textbox to set all variables to that one value. The same applies to adding and subtracting values. The add and subtract buttons can be inverted by right clicking on them and choosing to invert. You can click on the add/subtract button and hold the mouse down while holding control in order to continuously add to or subtract from the variables. Alternatively, right click on either button and choose to Start Continuous Add (or Subtract) and then later choose to Stop Continuous Add (or Subtract). You can create an Advanced Controller for a variable by clicking on the variable while holding C. Alternatively, you can create an Advanced Controller for multiple variables by selecting multiple variables, right clicking, and choosing to open a controller. Bit Controller : A Bit Controller is in charge of manipulating one variable. It consists of the following controls: Name Textbox : This shows the name of the variable being manipulated. Note that this can be edited. Decimal Value : This shows the decimal value of the variable. Hex Value : This shows the hex value of the variable. Binary Value : This shows the binary value of the variable. Value Table : This shows various representations of the bytes of the variable, including the decimal representation, hex representation, and binary representation. It also provides a set of checkboxes that can be used to toggle each bit of the variable. For floats, these checkboxes are colored according to the bits' role in the float, as blue represents sign, red represents exponent, and green represents mantissa. Note that for floats, you can right click on the empty space of the controller, and change what the textboxes display. Specifically, they can be set to display the sign, exponent, and mantissa values of the float. You can create a Bit Controller for a variable by clicking on the variable while holding B.

{"prompt": "Explain Hitbox", "completion": "Hitbox of a  Power Star This article is a  stub . As such, it is not complete. You can help Ukikipedia by  expanding it . A  hitbox  is an invisible shape commonly used in video games for real-time collision detection. It is often a rectangle or circle (in 2D games) or cuboid, cylinder, or sphere (in 3D) that is attached to and follows a point on an  object . They are used for collision detection. Contents 1   Hurtboxes 1.1   List 1.2   Uses 2   Collision hitboxes 3   Clone hitboxes 3.1   Overshadowing Hurtboxes If you typed  Hurtbox , you may be looking for the  interaction type  called  Hurtbox 1  or  Hurtbox 2 . Hurtboxes  are a specific type of hitbox that hurt Mario when he touches them. Many different enemies in the game have hurtboxes. List Goombas Explosions  (spawned by  Bob-ombs  and  Mines ) Bowser Bubble Bombs Fire Clams Chests And many more. Note that  lava  is a  floor  with a special property, not a hurtbox. Uses Because hurtboxes provide an easy way to damage Mario, they create an easy way to utilize  Pause Buffered Hitstun . The hurtbox of fire also gives a small vertical boost, which is useful in the  A Button Challenge . Collision hitboxes Many hitboxes push Mario away, such as those of Bob-ombs and  Chuckyas . These are necessary for  Quick Release  and are also the basis for the  Bloated Bob-omb  and  Handsfree Teleported Bob-omb  glitches, which work because the Bob-omb's size is large enough that its hitbox pushes Mario back, but it moves with him because he's holding it. Clone hitboxes Cloned objects that Mario can pick up normally act normal when set down, and have normal hitboxes. However, clones of objects never meant to be held have odd hitboxes. The majority of them can be interacted with only once by Mario, if at all. Platforms are intangible, and most enemies can injure Mario once and then become intangible. Coins can only be collected once, but don't disappear.  Shells  and  Bullies  are exceptions to this rule, as they can be interacted with multiple times. Overshadowing Clone hitboxes overshadow the hitboxes of other clones of the same type. For example, Mario can release a  fire  clone and will immediately get burned by it. Then, he can stand in its (now dormant) hitbox to release another without getting burned. This serves many purposes in the  A Button Challenge , including  Bowser in the Sky  and  Tick Tock Clock ."}

Mario  fights Bowser at the end of each  Bowser stage  in a circular arena surrounded by five  bombs . Mario must throw Bowser into these bombs to defeat him. Bowser's moves and HP change after each fight. Contents 1   Information 2   First Fight (Bowser in the Dark World) 2.1   Moves 3   Second Fight (Bowser in the Fire Sea) 3.1   Moves 4   Third Fight (Bowser in the Sky) 4.1   Moves Information Mario can  grab Bowser's tail  with a special  action  called Picking Up Bowser. This action can be entered by  diving  into Bowser or by pressing B when having been near his tail and not having been too far from him since then, and can be done even if the A button is held. Mario then enters  Holding Bowser  when swinging him and finally  Releasing Bowser  when throwing him. Bowser is a special type of grab called a  rotational grab , separate from  light grab  and  heavy grab . He updates the  HOLP , but appears in front of Mario rather than at the HOLP when released. First Fight (Bowser in the Dark World) In  Bowser in the Dark World , Bowser has an initial HP stat of 1. Moves Dance: Bowser can dance. This stops him from moving or turning for the duration of an animation. There is a 10% chance for him to dance at the start of the fight. Breathe fire: Bowser breathes fire in front of him, spawning many  flames  on the ground in certain patterns. As the fire despawns, a few  coins  appear. Leap: Bowser does a short leap towards Mario, causing Mario to be stunned for a moment if he is on the ground when Bowser lands. Recover: If Bowser is thrown off the stage, he will jump back onto the stage, stunning Mario if he is on the ground when Bowser lands. Second Fight (Bowser in the Fire Sea) In  Bowser in the Fire Sea , Bowser has an initial HP stat of 1. Moves Jump: Bowser jumps high into the air, causing the entire stage to tilt when he lands. He stands completely still after landing and is immune to being grabbed until the tilting animation ends. He will always do this move at the start of the fight. Fireball: Bowser shoots a single flame that follows Mario. Teleport: Bowser briefly turns invisible and teleports near Mario. Dash: Bowser dashes towards Mario, typically when Mario is far from Bowser. If he passes Mario, he will slide to a stop. If he hits the edge of the map, he'll halt in place for a few seconds, giving Mario a chance to grab him. Recover: If Bowser is thrown off the stage, he will jump back onto the stage, causing the entire stage to tilt similarly to when he performs his jump attack. Third Fight (Bowser in the Sky) In  Bowser in the Sky , Bowser has an initial HP stat of 3. Moves Fireball: Bowser shoots a single fire that follows Mario. Breathe fire: Bowser breathes fire into the air, which rains down onto the stage. Fire is spawned all around, including two blue flames which each split into 3 moving blue flames, one of which will move towards where Mario was when the fire landed. As the fire despawns, a few coins appear. Jump: Bowser jumps high into the air, creating shockwaves on the ground when he lands. Dash: Bowser dashes towards Mario, similarly to the Bowser 2 fight. Dance: When Bowser has 1 HP remaining, he will dance, causing large chunks of the stage to fall away. Afterwards, the stage will be much smaller and in the shape of a star. Recover: If Bowser is thrown off the stage, he will jump back onto the stage. If he lands on a part of the stage that can fall from his dance attack, it will fall and he will jump forward again. When he lands on a part of the stage that cannot fall, he creates a shockwave. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Objects Enemies Regular Amp  \u2022  Bob-omb  \u2022  Boo  \u2022  Bookend  \u2022  Bomp  \u2022  Bub   \u2022  Bubba  \u2022  Bullet Bill  \u2022  Bully  \u2022  Chain Chomp  \u2022  Chuckya  \u2022  Fly Guy  \u2022  Goomba  \u2022  Grindel  \u2022  Haunted Chair  \u2022  Heave-Ho  \u2022  Klepto  \u2022  Koopa  \u2022  Lakitu  \u2022  Mad Piano  \u2022  Moneybag  \u2022  Monty Mole  \u2022  Mr. Blizzard  \u2022  Mr. I  \u2022  Piranha Plant  \u2022  Fire Piranha Plant  \u2022  Pokey  \u2022  Scuttlebug  \u2022  Skeeter  \u2022  Snufit  \u2022  Spindel  \u2022  Spindrift  \u2022  Spiny  \u2022  Sushi  \u2022  Swoop  \u2022  Thwomp  \u2022  Tox Box  \u2022  Unagi  \u2022  Whomp Bosses King Bob-omb  \u2022   Big Boo  \u2022   Big Bully  \u2022  Bowser  \u2022  Eyerok  \u2022  Manta Ray  \u2022  Whomp King  \u2022  Wiggler NPCs Bob-omb Buddy  \u2022  Koopa the Quick  \u2022  Penguin  \u2022  Hoot  \u2022  MIPS  \u2022  Toad  \u2022  Ukiki  \u2022  Yoshi Other Objects Common Yellow Coin  \u2022  Blue Coin  \u2022  Red Coin  \u2022  1-Up Mushroom  \u2022  Bowling Ball  \u2022  Cannon  \u2022  Power Star  \u2022  Seesaw platforms  \u2022  Wing Cap  \u2022  Vanish Cap  \u2022  Metal Cap  \u2022  Elevator  \u2022  Sign  \u2022  Wooden post  \u2022  Cork Box  \u2022  Crazy Box  \u2022  Teleporter  \u2022  Warp Pipe  \u2022  Secret Level Specific Big Boo's Haunt tilting platform  \u2022  Merry-Go-Round  \u2022  Treadmill  \u2022  Pendulum  \u2022  Spinner  \u2022  Bowser Bomb  \u2022  Bowser key  \u2022  Grand Star  \u2022  Lethal Lava Land Drawbridge  \u2022  Tilted Inverted Pyramid Platform  \u2022  BitDW Trapdoor  \u2022  Controllable Platform  \u2022  Boulder Unused Boo key  \u2022  Bowser Anchor  \u2022  Fish spawner  \u2022  Trampoline  \u2022"}
{"prompt": "Explain Angle", "completion": "Angles  are a measurement of a separation between two rays. Using trigonometry, angles give substantial information relating to the position and velocity of an object. Yaw, Pitch and Roll Yaw, Pitch, and Roll are the three turning directions that can be used to represent any angle in 3D space. Yaw is the angle along the X-Z axes. This angle is taken relative to the positive Z-axis, meaning that directly facing the positive Z-direction corresponds to an angle of 0, while facing directly away corresponds to 180 degrees. Pitch is the angle along the Y-Z axes.  Roll is taken along the Y-X axes.  Trigonometry Instead of calculating them in real time, the game uses a look-up table for values of the trigonometric functions Sine and Cosine. Angular Unit An  angular unit  or  angle unit  is a unit of measurement that describes an angle, specifically yaw, pitch, and roll. An angular unit in Super Mario 64 is equal to 1/65536 of a circle. This translates to about .0055 degrees per unit, or about 182 units per degree. Since the game's trigonometry look-up table is only 1/16 as precise, two different angles may be considered the same if they both are rounded to the same value. Since 16 angular units is less than .1 degrees, this is never noticeable in regular gameplay but can come in to play in with large speed values (e.g. for  PU  movement)."}

Entering Hazy Maze Cave  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/uDtInisrqqM   The platform leading to the course is 205 units above the lowest floor [1] . The only known way to enter the course without pressing A is by using a  Star Dance Clip  using the star awarded by catching MIPS since Mario can grab onto ledges during his star dance animation. This maneuver can only be done twice as MIPS only appears twice throughout the game (when Mario has 15 stars for the first time and 50 stars for the second time), and will not reappear afterwards. MIPS will still respawn normally as long as its star is not collected. It should be noted that MIPS used to be required to drain the moat to access  Vanish Cap Under the Moat , which can now be done faster without MIPS by exploiting the misalignments at one corner of each pillar. Unlike ground pounding the pillars with MIPS, which uses only the object (MIPS) and not the star, grabbing the ledge leading to HMC requires MIPS to be present and Mario collecting its star. Swimming Beast in the Cavern  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/kd5TgsxVT7Y   Conveniently, there is a well-known glitch that allows Mario to clip through the elevator by standing at a certain black spot on the wall. When the elevator descends from above, the object collision will cause Mario to go past the wall and fall into the underground cavern, heading towards the island where the star is located.  Elevate for 8 Red Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/lT3SnMMLY0w   Jumping off a pole requires an A press, as it is the only way to get to the nearby platform without external help. In the past, Pannenkoek collected the star in 0.5 A presses [2]  by utilizing high negative speed to traverse the course and land on the moving platform necessary to reach the red coins located on higher platforms. An A press was held until this point in order to conserve speed up the elevator. In order to build such speed (more than 1500), Pannenkoek started  Hyperspeed Walking  (HSW) using the ceiling under the gate to keep him in place, navigated to the upper part of the course, and then bounced on a prepositioned scuttlebug to cross a large gap to clip into the red coins room.  Later in 2015, an improvement was made to reduce the A press count to 0 by  Scuttlebug Raising , and the TAS run was completed on June 26, 2016. A polished run with visual explanations was uploaded on February 25, 2018.  Mario first transported two scuttlebugs to the big gap leading to the left door and entered the red coins room on the right. Next, he transported the scuttlebug in that room close to the door Mario came from for raising. Then, he went back to the big gap and bounced on the two scuttlebugs he set up previously. Once he returns to the starting area, he heads towards the red coins room and begins raising the scuttlebug near the door. The repetitive segment takes 56 minutes to complete. Finally, Mario enters the room, grabs the pole, and patiently waits for the raised scuttlebug to drop down, pushing Mario to the nearby platform. Mario runs to the moving platform and begins completing all eight red coins to complete the mission. To reach the star (which is 300 units high [3] ), Mario bounces on a nearby scuttlebug. In December 2022, a new optimization was released for this star, saving roughly 55min. This is achieved by raising the scuttle inside the mesh wall in a way that it can drop under Mario on the pole. [4] Metal-Head Mario can Move!  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/69NMgKGFKC0   Mario arrives at the underwater cavern, and he presses the switch with a metal cap to open the gate. To begin the setup of hyperspeed, Mario enters the hallway to let the scuttlebug spawn for Mario and angle it away from the door; this is done to avoid the scuttlebug jumping when it sees Mario entering with super speed when facing Mario, causing Mario's bounce to fail. Mario builds up a large amount of negative speed by  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  (HSWS) on the slippery slope of the island. In order to accumulate speed, Mario enters the slippery slope and keeps in a standing position by holding C^ and enters the water, and then he gets out of the water with  conserved speed  by pressing Z to enter the sliding state. This is done repeatedly until Mario obtains negative 496 speed, slow enough to slide on  Dorrie  for 3 frames to get a sitting position for punching, but still fast enough to clip through the wall. A faster strategy is then available once the HSW strategy is discovered, allowing Mario to build up the required speed much faster. As early as the strategy is known, it was not made into TAS until a documented it [5] . Navigating the Toxic Maze  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/b5zwE4ALeoI   Mario has to enter the toxic maze for the star. The hardest part is exiting the maze via the doors on higher platforms, without pressing A to jump. To avoid pressing A, Pannenkoek needs very good RNG to set the swoopers flying at desirable angles and bounce on three of them at the right moment. The reason such strategy can work is that swoopers fly in three different heights: low, middle, and high; this allows Mario to bounce on them in ascending order. Afterwards, Mario can ride the elevator and collect the star. A-Maze-Ing Emergency Exit  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/lwcGE7Js1QE   The two main difficulties are exiting the toxic maze and crossing the gap to the A-Maze-Ing Emergency Exit platform. In the past, Pannenkoek utilized Hyper Speed Walking again to collect the star in 0.5 A Presses [6]  until the scuttlebug raising technique is found. Mario transports the scuttlebug to a point close to the A-Maze-Ing Emergency Exit star and then exits the maze by bouncing on a Monty Mole and a flying swooper. Once Mario reaches the door leading to the star, the prepositioned scuttlebug is then being raised for 35 minutes. Finally, Mario manipulates it to lunge towards the midpoint, allowing him to bounce on it and clear the gap, landing on the platform. Mario then collects the star. Watch for Rolling Rocks  (0x) Main article:  Watch for Rolling Rocks Video\u00a0:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFx7woWkZbc   The main breakthrough for collecting this star 0xA was the discovery that it is possible to clip the  controllable platform  in the red coin rooms out of bounds. The trick was named  Mario's Platform Adventure , and it allowed the transport of enemies beyond their default room. This allows Mario to enter a hallway with swoopers and guide them to the nearby elevator to raise their heights and clip them through the wall onto the controllable platform. They are then brought to the room with the star and clipped back in bounds. A scuttlebug is raised up to the platform, and another swooper is lured over to the platform as well. Finally, Mario uses  Vertical Speed Conservation , bounces on all three swoopers and the scuttlebug, and performs a  Glitchy Ledge Grab  to reach the platform. [7] HMC 100 coins  (0x) Video 1 (main strategy):  https://youtu.be/oqji_Lr1lFc   Video 2 (alternate, faster strat):  https://youtu.be/-F61DW6eFHo   Multiple techniques are required to get 100 coins in Hazy Maze Cave, as resources are limited. Using good maneuvering, Mario dives onto a high platform to kill a Mr. I and then proceeds to the underwater cavern by clipping through a wall. Mario then collects most of the coins there before returning to the upper part of the course using the elevator and enter the toxic maze. The major breakthrough (in the first video) is finding a way to ground pound the blue coin switch without A presses. Mario manipulates RNG for the four swoopers to fly in the desired path. Mario then does a first frame landing of a dive recover onto the blue coin and punches towards the edge of the platform. At the right moment, Mario reactivates the stored vertical speed (with  VSC ) by punching off the platform, and bounces on two swoopers to ground pound the block. After collecting the blue coins close to the ground (and not the topmost blue coin), Mario then waits for the other two swoopers and a snuffit to line up so that he can leave the maze by bouncing on them, collecting the coins on the exit platform, and then return to the maze to collect the enemy coins. Mario then collects the 100 coin star in the maze. Later in 2015 (in the second video), Pannenkoek found a way to collect the topmost blue coin by bouncing on the third swooper. The primary obstacle is that there are very few swooper paths that do this since the swooper needs to stay close to Mario when the VSC to ground-pound movement is performed. Additionally, the said swooper must head towards the blue coin when the switch's effect is active. Altogether, it takes a lot of effort to find a swooper path that satisfies all of the above. With 99 coins, Mario uses a Monty Mole and the fourth swooper to simultaneously land on the exit platform and collect the swooper's coin, spawning the 100 coin star. With this strategy, Mario can collect the star at the exit of the toxic maze, instead of having to collect the 100 coin star within the maze with no way out, forcing him to exit the course by dying and then reenter it. Other challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge , with  Metal-Head Mario Can Move!  requiring falling onto the purple switch with enough speed to press it without the  Metal Cap . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected.  Swimming Beast in the Cavern  is almost possible, with only the small lip of the elevator preventing Mario from getting onto it. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected, as they all require entering doors. In the  Pacifist Challenge , every star except for  100 Coins  can be collected, because there are not enough coins to collect without killing enemies. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected.  Metal-head Mario Can Move!  requires a BLJ to bypass the gate, and  Navigating the Toxic Maze  requires precise wall kicks to bypass the elevator. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to get more coins than intended.

Version 2  must be used for boos to show up in the merry-go-round.  A Button Challenge Video:  https://youtu.be/6q6e03g2Ic8   It is possible to get this star with  0 A presses . The biggest obstacle is finding a way to reach the star since it is 357 units above the floor [2] . After many ideas trying to go out of bounds to utilize VSC failed, Pannenkoek eventually found a method to use a scuttlebug's bounce to reach the star.  To execute this strategy, Mario first needs to lure a scuttlebug outside the mansion to a specific location via  Scuttlebug  transportation, and then raise it for many hours (3 hours or 10 hours depending on which method is used [3] ). This will place a scuttlebug in a vertical  PU  (VPU 1). Then, Mario will go outside to perform a specific maneuver to lure the scuttlebug to the specified location as it is falling through floors and ceilings, ending up above a floor in the merry-go-round by snapping it to a wall nearby via scuttlebug wall snapping. The movement is very precise as to not prematurely let it interact with the wrong wall in the VPU and snap into the wrong location. Once the scuttlebug is in place, Mario enters the merry-go-round room, beating up boos and proceeding the level as normal, and finishes up by bouncing on the scuttlebug to reach the star.

Coins The max amount of coins for this stage is 133, being split between outside and inside of the volcano (107 outside, 26 inside). This stage is also to home to possibly the most difficult non-glitchy coin in the game- a high bully in the volcano that requires a leap of faith to grab before it lands in the lava.

Bully the Bullies  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/_szjkqYGwkI   Mario goes to the platform with three bullies present and defeats all the bullies on the platform. The star is then collected by a lava boost nearby. 8-Coin Puzzle with 15 Pieces  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/4PXUXKf2ghU   Bowser's puzzle is reached by sliding kicking and dive-recovering. The eight coins on the puzzle are then quickly collected for the star to appear since the geometry of the course is mostly flat, easing navigation. Red-Hot Log Rolling  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/BxCJYoxELvk   As the shell is not available at this point, Mario must reach the log behind the steel-grate platform without a shell. After a couple of lava boosts, Mario gets on top of the log and rolls on it, and finally collects the star with a well-timed dive. Hot-Foot-It into the Volcano  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/Po3yFHGTieE   Mario enters the volcano. For the next two stars, Mario will utilize the lava boost from the \"lavafall\", but the major obstacle is how many lava boosts Mario can use without dying. Fortunately, a spinning heart is nearby allowing Mario to regain HP, allowing Mario to reach the destination with 0 A presses with a complicated route.  First, Mario gets on the moving platform with a lava boost and ZB bounces onto the lavafall (Mario is immune to lava effects when slide kicking) to land on the narrow bridge above with 2 lava boosts. Once there, Mario descends to the spinning platform and exploits the heart healing Mario's HP for an extended duration. Mario then moves back to the bottom of the lavafall quickly (since the higher platform is too high to reach) to go back to the higher platform with 3 lava boosts, restores HP with 3 coins, and quickly uses one more to reach the small platform with a pole. From there, Mario performs the final movement of ZB bouncing to the lavafall with height (while collecting 2 coins to restore HP) and uses 2 more lava boosts to reach Hot-Foot-It into the Volcano platform, collecting the star. Elevator Tour in the Volcano  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/IrXqE6DDt0I  (26 hours, non-Shindou only) Video:  https://youtu.be/i_2K_2UOcNM  (1 minute) A sequence of slow bully battery, fast bully battery, PU rotational displacement, then PU movement made the star possible in 0 A presses. This star still required 1 A press on Shindou versions of the game due to the bully death cancel being patched. However, a much faster strategy was found by using hyperspeed lava boosting to reach the star platform from the lavafall, which also worked on Shindou. LLL 100 coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/b3XxfYRYPHo   There are enough coins to collect outside the volcano, and so Mario collects most of the coins using a shell and grabs additional coins from bullies and Mr. I. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , every star except the two inside the volcano can be collected. They all utilize lava boosts to traverse between the platforms. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , no stars can be collected, as it is impossible to escape the starting platform. In the  Pacifist Challenge , every star except for  Boil the Big Bully  and  Bully the Bullies  can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Red-Hot Log Rolling ,  Hot-Foot-It into the Volcano , and  Elevator Tour in the Volcano  can be collected. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: getting more coins than intended, cloning with the  Crazy Box , to reach a  Parallel Universe  in the main level, and dying in a vertical  PU . Cloning Since there is a  Crazy Box  in Lethal Lava Land, it is theoretically possible to make clones by dropping the Crazy Box and then grabbing it as it explodes. No method has been found to successfully accomplish this, however. The crazy box can be instant released by diving into the side of the platform it sits on, but currently efforts to move it to a place it can be grabbed have been unsuccessful. It is worth noting that grabbing the Crazy Box fake would not allow for any extra coins. Grabbing a fake Crazy Box results in the crazy box being destroyed without dropping any of its original coins, and without respawning, so if the fake box was used to clone a coin it would result in a net loss of 4 coins. Note that a ring of 8 coins is impossible to clone without a loading zone.

{"prompt": "Explain Emulator", "completion": "Emulators  may be used for speedrunning Super Mario 64 in lieu of an actual console. They are the second-fastest platform allowed, having no lag but the same load times as N64. Due to being very inexpensive (if not free) to set up, it is strongly recommended for new runners to start out on emulator first to get a feel for the game, before committing to the high cost of a decent console setup. Permitted Emulators Only these three emulators  are permitted for the RTA leaderboards: Project64 1.6  (Windows only, recommended) Rosalie's Mupen GUI  (Windows and Linux) OpenEMU  (Mac only) Newer versions of Project64 are banned from the leaderboards as load times tend to vary across computers, whereas load times are fairly consistent on version 1.6. If you are using Project64 or Rosalie's Mupen GUI,  you  must  set Counter Factor to 1  in your emulator settings to remove emulated lag, otherwise your run will be rejected on Speedrun.com. If you are using OpenEMU, in which Counter Factor  cannot  be toggled, please indicate so in the run's description when submitting. Obtaining the ROM You will need a ROM of either the  original Japanese  (NTSC-J 1.0) or  North American  (NTSC-U) version for speedruns. Distributing official ROM files is illegal, so they cannot be provided here; you will have to obtain one on your own. N64 ROMs are stored as either  .z64  or  .n64  files, or a  .zip  containing one of the two ( never  as an  .exe  file).   To verify that you have the correct Super Mario 64 ROM, you can use  this tool  to compare your ROM's MD5 hash to the following: NTSC-J 1.0 Super Mario 64 (J) [!].z64 MD5: 85d61f5525af708c9f1e84dce6dc10e9 NTSC-U  Super Mario 64 (U) [!].z64 MD5: 20b854b239203baf6c961b850a4a51a2 The other two versions, namely the  European version  (PAL) and the  Shindou Edition  (NTSC-J 1.3), should be avoided: The European version runs ~17% slower, at 25 FPS rather than 30 FPS. This results in significant timeloss compared to any other version of the game. The Shindou Edition patches out BLJs, making any category below 70 Star impossible, and suffers from slower load times. (Shindou's primary benefit of less lag is irrelevant due to emulators completely bypassing it.) v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e RTA Guide Platforms Nintendo 64  \u2022  Virtual Console  \u2022  Emulator Categories 0/1 Star  \u2022  16 Star  \u2022  70 Star  \u2022  120 Star  \u2022  31 Star  \u2022  50 Star  \u2022  All\u00a0!

Most of the coins can be pretty easily collected without using A. The bomps are low enough to be traversed with a dive recover. At the top, Mario can reach the floating islands with a well-timed dive recover. He can then get the red coin above the thwomp by dropping down with a slidekick bounce. TAS TAS Strategy Without 100 Coins Mario begins by launching off the tree to the wet ground. He then heads to the slope and wall kicks to the red coin there. He then quickly traverses the slope with 2 kicks and performs another wall kick to get to the rotating platform. He performs an  edge grind , allowing him to jump dive, and collect the mid-air red coin on the way. He collects the next 2 coins between the piranha plants, then does a sideflip and a jump dive to get to the island. Mario collects the 2 coins and heads to the lower island where he drops and kicks to collect the coin above the thwomp. He then drops down to the last coin on the bomp, and does a jump dive before getting the coin so that he has speed after the star spawning animation. He then collects the star with a dive recover off of the elevated dirt path.  With 100 Coins Mario begins on the dirt path and collects the  coin line  and red coin there. He then turns and double jump dives off the bomp to the stone ramp. He heads across the wet area, collecting all coins. He dives onto the red coin on the slope, and heads to the cannon area. Mario collects all coins as he moves to the overhead area. He throws the  cork box  at the wall and collects the coins as he climbs up the platforms. After collecting the  coin ring , he heads right to the rotating bridge where he long jumps across the gap where the coins are and performs 2 1st frame wall kicks to collect all coins and increase  speed . Mario lands and kicks across the plank. He then  long jumps  onto a slope and slides down, then jumps to the red coin above the thwomp. He  triple jumps  on the thwomp and due to the design of the platforms, is able to touch the  floor  from the bottom, snapping him to the top of the island. He collects all coins on the island, and drops down, killing the piranha plant. While the priahna plant dies, Mario collects the red coin on the ledge, and wall kicks.

{"prompt": "Explain Transport cloning", "completion": "Transport cloning  is a type of  cloning  that will also move an object colliding with the cloned object. The glitch was first discovered by pannenkoek2012 while he was cloning goombas and accidentally displaced a koopa. [1]  The technique has had many usages since then, mainly allowing a single HOLP to place many different objects at different locations. Behavior Transport cloning is caused by coding on certain objects that treats how objects collide with each other. The object being pushed (pushee) is the one that needs to be cloned, and will pull the pusher along with it (although the pusher is the one with the code that causes this). The pushee will go to the Y-coordinate of the HOLP, and the average X & Z coordinates between their original location and the HOLP. The pusher only goes to the average X & Z coordinates, while keeping his current Y-coordinate. Only five different objects can be the pusher- Goomba, Spiny, Wiggler, Koopa (only if he is moving), and Skeeter. The pushee group is a bit more complicated and larger. All of those objects can push any object in Item Group 2- a group composed mainly of bob-ombs, their explosions, and cork boxes. Goomba, Spiny, and Koopa (all items in item Group 5) can also push each other and Lakitu. Usage Many of the uses for this glitch save time, as constantly having to set HOLP's costs a large deal of time. It also removes the need to continually rebuild a goomba structure as you make it, which is another large time sink.

To complete it, Mario must hit the item box on the floating island and collect the Power Star inside. This can be accomplished through many means such as using a nearby cannon to reach the island, or simply long-jumping from the mountain summit.  Contents 1   A Button Challenge 2   TAS History [7] 2.1   TAS Strategy 3   References A Button Challenge The first method discovered was to use a  Goomba structure  to get on the island. [5]  It was originally thought that 15 goombas were required, but upon closer examination, it was clear only 7 were needed. Before getting up to the top of the island, a bowling ball is placed below the star box by crouching while holding a clone, releasing it at the HOLP but at Mario\u2019s height. This is use to release a goomba clone below the star box so that Mario can utilize its bounce to reach the star, which is too high for a dive recover to reach. The first method soon was replaced with faser strategies. One time save involved using a single  Goomba   clone  and a  bloated Bob-omb  to reach the island. Since then, this star can be done 0x in just over 30 seconds. [6]  This is done by using shell hyperspeed to build up roughly 450 speed, then climbing the mountain and speeding off the edge and landing directly ontop of the star box.

TAS Strategy The original strategy was to  BLJ  off of the elevator, then travel up the mountain, starting at a steep slope near the bottom. Mario then launches off the side of the mountain and lands on the island. This was replaced by a new strategy in the  \"120 Star TAS (2012)\" . After BLJing on the evelator, mario grabs onto a tree to convert his speed into forewards speed, then double jump dives off of a nearby rock, which lands him onto the island. Although not a faster strategy, in late 2015 Tomatobird8 found an interesting strategy which was similar to the double jump strategy, but instead of BLJing off of the elevator, used a  Cork Box  and the sloped bridge to build speed.

The \"whoosh\" sound that plays while spinning Bowser is not indicative of whether he is pointing towards a bomb; try to focus on aiming  visually . It is highly recommended that runners who play using an original Nintendo 64 controller switch to a different controller for Bowser fights, as rapidly spinning the N64 controller's stick will wear it down.

It is especially useful in the  A Button Challenge Explanations When Mario does certain actions, a  Dive Recover  for example, he is in a state where he cannot grab any ledge. However, grabbing a star will immediately put him in the star dance action, which has the ability to grab ledges.  While the animation of the ledge grab does not play, Mario will appear at the top of the ledge just like if it had.

{"prompt": "Explain SheNaNigans", "completion": "SheNaNigans  are a category of glitches that occur due to  Mario 's position being  NaN . Obtaining a NaN position Due to the nature of floats and the N64 hardware, there is no currently known way for Mario to reach a position of NaN on an N64 due to the console crashing from a floating point exception long before obtaining this value, but it has been done on emulators. The basic idea is to first reach INF or -INF speed, and then have a joystick position that will multiply that speed by a zero value [ citation needed ] . A multiplication between 0 and -INF will return the value NaN. This has been achieved previously using the elevator  Big Boo's Haunt . Object Interaction Whenever Mario's position is NaN in any given axis, the game will make Mario interact with all objects on the plane of that axis. This is because the game return \"true\" by default when evaluating object collision, and a NAN value will always make any comparison return \"false\" [1] . This can be used to collect coins, stars or interact with any constantly loaded object.

Koopa the Quick only appears on his specific missions, being  Footrace with Koopa the Quick  and  Rematch with Koopa the Quick .  Glitches When Koopa the Quick interacts with a  bowling ball  coming toward him, he will jump over it. Similarly, when Koopa the Quick interacts with a bowling ball moving away from him, he'll slow down for it. Using Bowling Ball  clones , it is possible to manipulate Koopa the Quick. By placing a clone of a bowling ball facing toward him in certain spots, Mario can make him jump into cannons and chasms. By placing a clone facing away from him, Mario can make him slow down at will. By slowing him down with a clone, Koopa the Quick will begin to walk backwards, causing his animation to move into the negatives and display glitchy animations. Placing both a clone facing toward him and away from him can cause him to jump infinitely. [1]  This can be exploited to send him to parallel universes.

It can be accessed by going  upstairs  and going to the small painting of mushrooms. Since it is found upstairs, the bare minimum requirement to reach it is the key from  Bowser in the Fire Sea , so 31  Stars  are normally required to get to it (without the use of game-breaking glitches).

Version 3: When Star 3-6 is selected, neither the Scale the Mountain star nor the cage will be present. Collecting Coins There are a total of 137 coins in the course. When you clone coins using a bob-omb, each clone takes up a  slot  in memory that cannot be removed. However, if you go into the slide, and then exit out of the slide, the clones are gone, allowing the player to collect 999 coins.

Immediately hold up-right on the analog stick and press B. You'll clip through the slope into an area with some water. (To see this, press C-Left twice.) Swim forwards and swim towards the corner of the water. Swim off of it, and you'll teleport upwards to a higher part of the mountain. Speedrunners use this to skip past a long part of the mountain. A Press Counts In the A Button Challenge, it takes no A Presses to collect all seven stars. Entering Tall, Tall Mountain (0x) Similar to  The Princess's Secret Slide , the painting can be entered with a precise dive recover. Scale the Mountain (0x) This star is collected by using a techinical manuever with a rollout on the mountainside. [1] Mystery of the Monkey Cage (0x) Mario can climb the mountain easily with  Frame Walking , and he just grabs  Ukiki  and collects the star. [2] Scary 'Shrooms, Red Coins (0x) The star is mostly trivial due to frame walking. [3] Mysterious Mountainside (0x) With a  slide kick , Mario reaches the area where the star is easily and quickly. [4] Breathtaking View from Bridge (0x) Mario frame walks up the mountain, activates the  ! Switch  to make the  cork box  appear, then slide kicks into the star. [5] Blast to the Lonely Mushroom (0x) Mario grabs the  Crazy Box  at the beginning of the level, bouncing directly to the star. [6] 100 Coins Mario collects coins from  Chuckya ,  coin lines ,  coin rings , the Crazy Box, Goombas, and the slide. [7]  This is enough to get 100 coins. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  Scary 'Shrooms, Red Coins ,  Mysterious Mountainside ,  Breathtaking View from Bridge , and  Blast to the Lonely Mushroom  can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses.  Mystery of the Monkey Cage  requires using hyperspeed to get  Ukiki  off of the mountain, then grabbing it with the vertical wind.  Blast to the Lonely Mushroom  requires long jumping to the mushroom on the JP 1.0 version to avoid opening the cannon. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Scale the Mountain ,  Mysterious Mountainside ,  Breathtaking View from Bridge , and  Blast to the Lonely Mushroom  can be collected. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: collecting  Mystery of the Monkey Cage  without changing the HOLP for an arbitrary HOLP and reaching a  Parallel Universe  in any of the areas of the level.

{"prompt": "Explain Hyperspeed Slide Kicking", "completion": "Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  ( HSSK ) is a  hyperspeed technique  where Mario builds up speed by slide-kicking repeatedly against an  unreferenced wall . Contents 1   Setup 1.1   Shell Clone HSSK 2   Notes 3   References Setup Mario is usually placed on the ground in the concave corner formed by 2 walls, so that he is running into the unreferenced one. By repeatedly slidekicking and recovering, Mario can build up a maximum of ~95 speed on normal floors and 282-400 speed [note 1]  on slippery ones (at that speed he will break through the wall). [1] Shell Clone HSSK Mario can also be placed on a shell clone instead of on the ground, as shell clones allow him to slidekick instantly without needing to crouch for a frame. Since he does not lose speed from crouching, the maximum speed achievable is again limited by the wall, so he can build up 282-400 speed [note 2] . [2] Notes \u2191   With axis aligned walls, the most distance Mario can move while still hitting both walls is when facing exactly 45\u00b0 into the referenced wall, allowing 200*sqrt(2) \u2248 282.84 speed. With perfect wall projections with walls ~45\u00b0 off from axis-aligned, it is possible for Mario to move parallel to the referenced wall while still touching its hitbox for 100 units, allowing 400 speed.

{"prompt": "Explain Frame", "completion": "A  frame  is a length of time in which a consecutive image is displayed on a screen. The term can also refer to the image being rendered in this time. The normal  framerate  of  Super Mario 64  is 30 FPS, meaning that 30 frames are rendered on-screen in a single second, but lag can decrease this frequency. Later games have largely adopted a 60 FPS framerate. Phenomena Normally, having a button down for two or more consecutive frames will be identified as holding it down, even if the button was pressed separately on each frame. This is unlikely to cause issues in  real-time gameplay , but it can prove problematic in  tool-assisted speedrunning . Pausing the game will separate these frames without changing any in-game states. A variable called the  global timer  increases by 1 on every frame. Some events occur depending on the parity of the global timer, or depending on other functions such as trigonometric calculations, so  pause buffering  can be used to alter the state of the game."}

{"prompt": "Explain Interaction Type - Hurtbox 1 & 2", "completion": "An  interaction type  is a property that all  objects  have. Most objects have exactly one interaction type, but some, such as particle effects and platforms, have zero. No object may have more than one, and if one is hacked to have more than one, it will  crash  the game as Mario thinks that he is interacting with two different objects, each with one interaction flag, and cannot find them. Interaction types are analogous to  action flags , but  interaction flags  are not, which can be a source of confusion.

This interaction first checks whether Mario is in a suitable state to grab the owl (fulfilled by several airborne states) and checks if the  global timer  has advanced more than 30 ticks since Mario last let go of Hoot. If both these conditions are met, Mario can grab onto Hoot. Note that since the global timer advances while the game is paused, it is possible to fulfill the second condition right after Mario lets go of Hoot by simply pausing the game for 30 frames. Since the Hoot interaction is the first interaction type internally, and is referenced by the  Beta Boo Key  and  Bowser  actors, it is possible that this interaction was repurposed from an earlier type of interaction that was used earlier in development. Grabbable The Grabbable interaction is used by objects which are grabbable, such as  Bob-ombs  and  cork boxes . This interaction has 5 subtypes: the grab Mario subtype which is used by  Chuckya  and  King Bob-omb  and also makes the object  heavy , the holdable NPC subtype which lets Mario drop the object gently with no forward velocity, the talking drop subtype which is used by grabbable NPCs that also talk to Mario so that Mario will drop them when their dialogue is finished, the kickable subtype for objects that can be kicked and the not grabbable which is used by  Heave-Ho  to prevent Mario from picking it up. For the grab to occur, Mario must not be kicking an object of the kickable subtype, the object must not have the not grabbable subtype, and the usual conditions for Mario to grab something must be met. If the object being interacted with is not  Bowser , the interaction is also set to push Mario 5 units away from the object when he grabs it. Door The Door interaction is used for  doors  and has a subtype used for Star Doors. When Mario interacts with a door, the game checks to make sure he is  walking  or  decelerating  before checking if he has enough  stars  to open it. If these conditions are met, the game initializes variables for whether to push or pull the door open and a variable for the door\u2019s flag in the save file. If the door Mario interacts with is a regular door, then at this point Mario will either push or pull the door open. If the door Mario interacts with is a star door, a separate check is done and  a different action  is done for Mario to enter the star door. If the door requires stars to open, the game also runs a check for whether or not the door has been opened before in the save file. If it has not, the game runs an action where Mario uses the power of the stars to open the door. If Mario does not have the required stars, the game displays dialogue dependent on how many stars are required to open the door. In the case where the door requires 70 stars to open (in the game, the  Endless Stairs  star door), the game displays dialogue and then allows Mario to open the door. Hurtbox 1 & 2 Hurtbox 1 & 2 are identical with their behavior. If Mario makes contact with an object, it will simply  knock him back  and generally hurt him. Some examples include  Chain Chomp ,  Mr. Blizzard , and  Bullet Bills . The only distinction between the two is solely based on what file they are in. Coin This interaction is used for collecting  coins , as the name implies. When the interaction occurs, the number of coins Mario has is increased by the value of the coin, his heal counter is increased by 4 times the value of the coin, and the coin\u2019s interaction status is updated to mark that an interaction has occurred. If the course is a main course, the number of coins Mario has minus the value of the coin is less than 100, and Mario has at least 100 coins, the  100 Coin Star  spawns. Cap This interaction is used for when Mario picks up  caps . When the interaction occurs, the game gets Mario\u2019s current cap status, and initializes two variables for the cap timer and cap music. If Mario is not currently being  blown  away and Mario is wearing some kind of cap already, the game sets Mario\u2019s interacted object variable to the object and sets the object\u2019s interaction attribute to reflect that it has been interacted with. If the object is a  Vanish Cap , the cap\u2019s timer is set to 600 and the music is set to the Wing Cap music. If the cap is a  Metal Cap , the cap\u2019s timer is set to 600 and the music is set to the Metal Cap music. If the cap is a  Wing Cap , the cap\u2019s timer is set to 1800 and the music is set to the Wing Cap music. If the cap timer from the cap just collected is greater than Mario\u2019s current cap timer, Mario\u2019s cap timer is set to the collected object\u2019s cap timer. If Mario is  idle  or  walking , Mario  puts the cap on . Otherwise, Mario\u2019s flags are updated to have a cap on his head directly. Then, two sounds play and if the cap music is not set to 0, the cap music plays.  Pole This interaction is used for things Mario can  climb  i.e.  poles . When the interaction occurs, the game gets Mario\u2019s action and checks if it is a suitable action for pole climbing. If it is, the game checks if Mario is not already on a pole or if Mario\u2019s used object attribute is not set to the object he is interacting with. If the condition is met, the game sets a variable that tells whether or not Mario\u2019s forward  speed  is below 10, makes Mario stop riding or holding any object, set\u2019s Mario\u2019s interacted object and used object attributes to the object, sets Mario\u2019s forward and vertical velocities to 0, and sets several attributes regarding Mario and the pole. If Mario\u2019s speed is below 10, Mario grabs the pole slowly. Otherwise, Mario\u2019s pole yaw velocity is set to his forward velocity times 1.4 degrees plus 22.5 degrees, his pitch is reset, and his action is set to grabbing the pole quickly. Koopa Same as  Bounce Top . Spiny Used for the  Spiny  when it is walking around. When the interaction occurs, the game checks which interaction occurred between Mario and the object. If the interaction was a  punch , then the object has several variables updated and Mario is bounced back. Otherwise, if the interaction would cause Mario to be knocked back and take damage, it does so. If the object has the subtype that it delays the invincibility timer, it does so. Breakable Block This interaction is used for breakable objects such as  boxes . When the interaction occurs, the game checks to see which interaction occurred between Mario and the object. If the interaction was an attack, the game sets the object\u2019s interaction status to the attack and determines how Mario should bounce back from the attack. If Mario is in the air, his forward  speed  is set to -16 units/frame. If Mario is not in the air his forward speed is set to -48 units/frame. In the case where Mario hits the object from above, Mario is sent upwards with a Y-velocity of 30 units/frame. In the case where Mario hits the object from below, Mario\u2019s Y-velocity is set to 0 units/frame. Wind Used for when Mario is blown upward by strong  wind . When the interaction occurs, the game checks Mario\u2019s action to see if he is already blowing in the wind. If he is not, then Mario stops riding or holding any objects, Mario\u2019s facing  angle  is set to the wind\u2019s movement angle plus 180 degrees, his forward velocity is set to -24 units/frame, and his vertical velocity is set to 12 units/frame. A sound also plays, the  camera  is updated, and Mario\u2019s action is updated to reflect that he is  blowing in the wind . Warp Door Used for doors that take Mario to another  area , like the doors to the basement and upstairs of the castle. When the interaction occurs, the game checks whether Mario is either  walking  or  decelerating . If he is not, no further action is taken, if he is, the game proceeds with the rest of the interaction. If the door is the door to upstairs or door to the basement and Mario has not already unlocked it, the game checks if he has the right  key  for it. If he does not, the game displays text. If he does, Mario unlocks the door. If the door is not a locked door, the game decides whether Mario should push or pull the door open and then sends him through the warp.   Star/Key This interaction is used when Mario collects a  star  or a  key . The interaction has two subtypes: the no exit subtype and the  grand star  subtype. When the interaction occurs, the action Mario is to perform is set to a  star dance  with an exit afterwards. Two variables are also set to check whether the object being interacted with has the no exit or grand star subtype. If Mario\u2019s  health  is at least 256, meaning that Mario is not dead, then Mario stops riding or holding any objects and then the game runs several checks to determine what animation to play. If the object is not of the type no exit, Mario\u2019s hurt and heal counters are set to 0 and his cap timer is set to equal 1 if it is greater than 1. If the object is of the type no exit then the action Mario will perform is set to a star dance with no exit. If Mario is  swimming  or is wearing the  Metal Cap  underwater, then the action to be performed is set to the underwater star dance. If Mario is in the air the action is for Mario to fall and then do a star dance. After these checks, the game spawns a  smoke puff , updates the object to reflect that it has been interacted with, and sets Mario\u2019s interacted object and used object attributes to the object. Then, the game checks the object\u2019s star index and updates Mario\u2019s star count, if applicable. If the object is not of the no exit subtype, the level music is set to fade out. If the object is the Grand Star, Mario\u2019s action is set to begin the Grand Star collection cutscene. Otherwise, Mario\u2019s action is set to whatever action he was set to perform when the game checked each case. Warp Used for fade in  warps  and  pipes . When the interaction occurs, the game checks whether it is a fade warp or a pipe warp. If it is a fade warp, the game checks whether or not Mario has just faded in from the  teleport . If he has not, and if he is  idling ,  panting ,  standing against a wall , or  crouching , Mario is teleported via a fade out. If the warp is a pipe, and if Mario has not just emerged from the pipe, a sound plays, Mario stops holding or riding any objects, and Mario is warped via the pipe. Cannon Base This interaction is used for Mario entering a  cannon . When the interaction occurs, the game first checks to see if Mario is not already in a cannon. If he is not, Mario stops riding or holding any objects, the object is updated to reflect that it has been interacted with, Mario\u2019s interacted object and used object attributes are set to the object, and Mario\u2019s action is set so that he is in a cannon. Bounce Top Bounce top is used for objects Mario can bounce off of such as  Goombas . When an interaction between Mario and the object occurs, the game initializes a variable to store what kind of interaction occurred between Mario and the object. If Mario is wearing a metal cap, the variable is set to that of a fast attack. Otherwise, the game checks what sort of interaction occurred and sets the variable to that interaction. If the interaction is an attack, the game checks what kind of attack occurred, checks whether or not Mario should be bounced back from the attack, and then does further actions if the attack was Mario hitting the object from above. If Mario hit the object from above and the object is set to cause Mario to  twirl , Mario\u2019s vertical speed is set to 80, hit Y-position is set to be above the object\u2019s  hitbox , and his action is set to twirling. If Mario hit the object from above and the object is not set to make Mario twirl, Mario\u2019s vertical speed is set to 30 and his Y-position is set to be above the object\u2019s hitbox. If the interaction between Mario and the object was not an attack, then if the object is set to damage Mario and cause  knockback , it does so. If the object\u2019s interaction subtype is set to delay Mario\u2019s  invincibility  timer going down while the interaction is occurring, it does so. Water Ring This interaction is used by  water rings  like those spawned by the  Manta Ray  in  Dire, Dire Docks  and  Bubbles  in Dire, Dire Docks and  Jolly Roger Bay . When the interaction occurs, Mario\u2019s heal counter is increased by 4 times the object\u2019s \u201ccoin\u201d value and the object\u2019s interaction status is updated to mark that an interaction has occurred. Bully Used for  Bully  enemies. When the interaction occurs, the game checks for which interaction occurred between Mario and the object. If the interaction was Mario attacking the object, then Mario is pushed 5 units away from the object, his  forward velocity  is set to -16 units/frame, the object\u2019s moving  angle  is set to Mario\u2019s current facing angle, and the object\u2019s forward velocity is set to 3392 divided by the radius of the object\u2019s  hitbox . Otherwise, if Mario is not invulnerable or wearing the vanish cap, Mario\u2019s invincibility timer is set to 2, a sound plays, and Mario is knocked back by the object. Burns Used for objects that set Mario on  fire . If Mario is not invulnerable, not wearing a  Metal Cap , not wearing a  Vanish Cap , and not interacting with an object that delays the invincibility timer, the interaction proceeds. If Mario is  swimming  or if the distance between the  water level  at Mario\u2019s current position and Mario\u2019s current Y-position is greater than 50 (Mario is more than 50 units below the water level), a sound plays for putting a flame out. Otherwise, Mario\u2019s burn timer is set to 0, the camera is updated, and a sound plays for Mario being set on fire. If Mario is in the air with a vertical speed less than or equal to 0, Mario\u2019s action while burning is a burning fall. Otherwise, the action is a burning jump.  Koopa Shell This interaction is used for the  Koopa Shell  Mario can  ride . When the interaction occurs, first the game checks whether or not Mario is already riding a shell. If he is not, the game runs a function to determine what interaction occurred between Mario and the object. If the interaction with the object is Mario hitting it from above, or if Mario\u2019s action is set to walking, Mario\u2019s interactObj, usedObj, and riddenObj attritubes are set to the object, the game updates Mario\u2019s sound and camera to reflect him riding the shell, the shell music begins, Mario drops any held objects, and Mario\u2019s action is set to riding the shell. Bounce Top/Bottom Used for enemies Mario can kill from below. When the interaction occurs, the game checks for which interaction occurred between Mario and the object. If the interaction was an attack by Mario, the object is bounced back. If the attack was from below, Mario\u2019s  vertical speed  is set to 0. If the attack was from above, Mario bounces off the object either by twirling or by a regular bounce. Otherwise, if the interaction results in Mario taking  knockback  and damage, this occurs. If the interaction can freeze the invincibility countdown timer, it does so. Text This interaction is used for objects that display text when Mario interacts with them. When the interaction occurs, the game determines which interaction subtype it is. If the interaction has the  sign  subtype, the game returns a function for Mario to read the sign. If the interaction subtype is the NPC subtype, the game returns a function for Mario to talk to the NPC. Otherwise, the game pushes Mario 2 units away from the object.  Tornado This interaction is used for the  tornadoes  in  Shifting Sand Land . When the interaction occurs, the game checks to see if Mario is in the tornado  twirling  action or is  squished . If Mario is not in either of this states, Mario stops riding anything or holding anything if he is doing either of those things, his forward velocity is set to 0, a sound effect plays and Mario\u2019s action is set to the tornado twirling action. Whirlpool This interaction is used for the  Whirlpool  in  Dire, Dire Docks . When the interaction occurs, the game checks if Mario is already in the caught in whirlpool action. If Mario is not, Mario stops riding any object or holding any object if he is doing either of those things. Then, Mario\u2019s forward velocity is set to 0, a sound effect plays, and Mario\u2019s action is set to the caught in whirlpool action. Clam/Bubba This interaction is used for  Clams ,  Unagi , and  Bubba  and has a subtype for if the object can eat Mario. When the interaction occurs, if the interaction has the can eat Mario subtype, Mario is  eaten . Otherwise if Mario is in a state to take damage and  knockback , he does so. If the object has the subtype that it delays the invincibility timer, it does so. BBH Entrance This interaction is used for the  cage  Mario jumps into to enter  Big Boo's Haunt . When the interaction occurs, first the game checks to see if Mario is already in the act of  entering BBH . If he is not, Mario stops riding or holding any objects, the object is updated to reflect that it has been interacted with, and Mario\u2019s interacted object and used object attributes are set to the object. The game then sets Mario\u2019s action depending on whether or not he is in the air. If Mario is in the air, Mario\u2019s action is set so that he will spin into the BBH cage. If Mario is not in the air, his action is set so that he will jump into the BBH cage. Snufit Bullet Used for the  Snufit   bullet . When the interaction occurs, the game checks that Mario is not invulnerable or wearing a  Vanish Cap . If he is not but he is wearing a  Metal Cap , Mario takes no damage and the sound of the bullets bouncing off him plays. Otherwise, Mario takes damage without knockback, a sound plays, and his action is set based on what knockback the game determines Mario should take from the damage. Shocks Used for electrical interactions with  amps . When the interaction occurs, the game checks that Mario is not invulnerable or wearing a vanish cap. If he is not, Mario takes damage without knockback and a sound plays. Then, the game checks if Mario is swimming or walking underwater. If he is, Mario is set to his  underwater shock  action. Otherwise, he does his regular shock action. If the object can freeze the invincibility countdown timer, it does so. Igloo Barrier This article is a  stub . As such, it is not complete. You can help Ukikipedia by  expanding it . This interaction is used for the  Igloo Barrier  object in Snowman\u2019s Land. When the interaction occurs, the game runs a function that pushes Mario away from the object. Unusually, this interaction sets Mario\u2019s used object attribute without updating his action, unlike every other interaction in the game. This has the potential to cause several glitches, but these cannot be performed in regular circumstances since the Igloo Barrier is the only object to use this interaction. Special Cases A few objects can switch from their default interaction types in certain circumstances, mostly between hurtbox and another type. King Bob-omb King Bob-omb  normally uses the Grabbable interaction type. However, after King Bob-omb is thrown onto the ground, his interaction type is changed to Hurtbox until he gets back up. This is done to prevent Mario from picking up King Bob-omb immediately after throwing him. Bowser Bowser's  body's interaction type is normally Hurtbox. However, when Bowser is defeated, his body's interaction type is changed to Text. Spinies When  Spiny  is walking around, its interaction type is the Spiny type. However, if Spiny is not walking around or has just been hit by Mario, it is set to the hurtbox interaction type.  Piranha Plant When a Piranha Plant is sleeping, its interaction type is Bounce Top. When it is biting, its interaction type is Hurtbox. References Decomp File"}
{"prompt": "Explain Big Boo's Haunt tilting platform", "completion": "Big Boo's Haunt Tilting Platform Technical Constants Object Group Surface Actor Group N/A Tangibility Radius 2000 Draw Distance 4000 The  Big Boo's Haunt Tilting Platform  is an object appearing on the second floor of the house in  Big Boo's Haunt . When Mario stands on it, it begins to tilt. Behavior The platform's behavior differs between the initial Japanese release and later releases. In the Japanese version, if Mario is interacting with the platform, the platform\u2019s pitch velocity is set to be the distance from the object to Mario times the cosine of the angle between Mario and the platform. Then, the platform\u2019s facing angle is increased by the pitch velocity every frame. If Mario is not interacting with the platform, the platform will begin moving toward the horizontal at 200 angular units/frame (1.1 degrees/frame). If the platform\u2019s angle is within 200 angular units of the horizontal, its angle is set directly to 0 units. In the US version, if Mario is interacting with the platform, its action is set to the action for when Mario is on, and if Mario is not interacting with the platform, its action is set to the action for when Mario is off. The game then checks if the platform\u2019s action is set to the one for when Mario is on the platform. If it is, the platform\u2019s pitch velocity is set to be the distance from the object to Mario times the cosine of the angle between Mario and the platform. Then, the platform\u2019s facing angle is increased by the pitch velocity every frame. If the platform is not in the action for Mario being on, then, if the platform\u2019s angle has not tilted more than 3000 angular units (16.48 degrees) or if Mario was on the platform for more than 16 frames, the platform will begin moving toward the horizontal at 200 angular units/frame (1.1 degrees/frame). If the platform\u2019s angle is within 200 angular units of the horizontal, its angle is set directly to 0 units.  The key difference between the two versions is how quickly the platform begins to rotate back to the horizontal. In that Japanese version, this happens as soon as Mario gets off the platform no matter how far it has rotated. In the US version, if Mario gets off the platform and it has rotated more than 3000 angular units in less than 16 frames, the platform keeps rotating for another 16 frames and then moves back toward the horizontal. The other difference is in how the game handles whether Mario is on the platform or not. In the US version, the platform\u2019s action is updated, while this is not the case in the Japanese version. This was changed for the US version so that the platform\u2019s timer attribute is reset whenever Mario gets on or off the platform.

{"prompt": "Explain Parallel Universe - Vertical Parallel Universes", "completion": "A diagram of Parallel Universe movement in  Hazy Maze Cave , after  Mario  has returned to the main map. A  Parallel Universe , or  PU , is a region of space located far outside the intended map boundaries that reflects certain aspects, especially the floors and/or ceilings, of the main map. When the game looks for floors below (or ceilings above) a given object, it first \"truncates\" the object's position from a floating point value to a 16-bit integer value. The range of a floating point value is much larger than the range of a 16-bit integer value (which is -2 15  = -32,768 to 2 15  - 1 = 32,767). If a coordinate of the object's position falls outside this range, it \"wraps around\". For example, if one of these floating point values is 40,000, then 40,000 - 65,536 = -25,536 will be used when determining if the object is aligned with a floor or ceiling. This gives the illusion that the floors and ceilings of the main level map are \"copied\" repeatedly in a uniform 3D grid, at a spacing of 65,536 units.   Frame of Peter Fedak's video where he turns Parallel Universes visible using hacks; notice the lack of  objects The truncation responsible for the existence of parallel universes is only performed when determining alignment with floors and ceilings. This means that walls and objects, both of which use floating point arithmetic to determine collision, do not \"exist\" in PUs, unless they are brought there. Due to the extremely high speed required to travel to PUs, they are not accessible from all courses. The courses where PUs can or cannot be accessed are summarized in the tables below. Work is ongoing to try to access PUs in courses such as  Bowser in the Fire Sea  (via  Bully battery ) and demo courses (via massive  Spawning displacement ). Methods to access a PU are: Speed: EBLJ HSW HSP BB Speed Conservation Displacement: Pole Teleport Platform Displacement Note that EBLJ (and other types of BLJs), and BB (Bully battery) cannot be achieved on Shindou versions. Also, if a method requires to set  HOLP  in a PU, then it is only possible to do it on VC (because other versions crash if a camera is in the PU, and by locking camera on the main map, the HOLP wont update, because camera being too far is one of the cases where HOLP doesn't update).

However, these behave completely differently to horizontal PUs. While truncated coordinates are used to  find  the floor below the object and the ceiling above the object, the original floating point values are used to determine what  effect  these surfaces have on the object. For example, when Mario is less than 160 units below the nearest ceiling, he is considered to be \"above\" the ceiling, his vertical speed is killed, and he bonks. If Mario moves to a positive (upward) vertical PU, the \"nearest\" ceiling will be determined based on truncated coordinates, and will therefore be in the main map. But when checking whether he is above this ceiling, floating point coordinates are used instead, and so Mario behaves as though he is stuck in a ceiling. This behavior results in positive vertical PUs appearing to be filled entirely with ceilings. [2] On the other hand, when Mario is below his \"nearest\" floor, he will snap up to it. This means that if Mario moves to a negative vertical PU, he will usually upwarp back to the main PU grid. This is called an  overflow jump , or  OJ  for short. It is typically difficult to get to a vertical PU. In the positive direction, there is a ceiling at  y  = 20,000 that prevents upward movement. We can bypass this ceiling by pressing against OoB, for example by using  hyperspeed flying . We can also use  platform displacement  or  indefinite owl flight  to reach a positive vertical PU. In the negative direction, we can use a  negative jump  to jump downward with large amounts of negative speed, or platform displacement. Travel and movement   Mario looking to the original map from a PU   Mario  BLJing  to a PU Parallel universes have found uses in both speed TASes and the  A Button Challenge  since they allow greater control of movement through a level. PU routing is comparable to movement through a five-dimensional space, as Mario can be modeled as traveling along five axes: three \"relative\" axes describing his position within the map, and two integers to specify which PU he is currently in. These PU axis integers are Mario's coordinates on the PU grid. Mario can adjust his  speed  and  angle  to move relatively around the stage regardless of how many PUs he moves in the  x  or  z  dimensions. Mario's movement is split up into four  quarter steps , and if any of these quarter steps attempts to place Mario out of bounds, his movement is canceled. Therefore in order to move to a PU, Mario's speed must be a multiple of four times the distance between PUs. If Mario takes all four quarter steps, then he will move four PUs in a single frame. This distance is called the  Quadruple Parallel Universe , or  QPU , distance. If one of Mario's quarter steps (other than the first one) ends out of bounds, the game will cut his movement short. In this case, Mario does not travel the full QPU distance, and instead ends at whichever PU he made it to before his intended quarter step became out of bounds. He is then \"QPU misaligned.\" As traveling to PUs involves moving very far from the origin, floating point imprecision can begin to have a significant effect on Mario's position, angle, and collision. When Mario's position becomes large enough, this imprecision will result in the coordinates in PUs becoming so coarse that Mario cannot cross from one coordinate to the next and, eventually, will result in certain PUs being completely unaccessible. Floating point truncation crash While in theory the grid of PUs extends indefinitely, the behavior of the truncation operation becomes \"undefined\" when the floating point value is outside the range -2 31  to 2 31  - 1. The Nintendo 64 and  iQue  Player [3]  versions of the game crash when such a truncation is attempted. The Wii and Wii U virtual console versions of the game do not crash, though it is not currently known whether they wrap around the 32-bit integer range, or cap to the endpoints of the range. Most emulators do not properly emulate the crash, except for a specific version of Mupen64, modded to crash correctly. While movement to PUs at coordinates this large is rarely useful, this crash can occur due to other instances of truncation in the game, even in PUs close to the main map. For example, when determining Mario's tilt while walking, the game multiples Mario's speed by 16,384 and then truncates this value. This means that the game can crash in certain conditions when Mario has a speed of about 131,000, which is below QPU speed. While not all conditions for these types of crashes are known, there are some that come up frequently. These are when: The camera enters a PU Mario bonks while in a PU Mario's quarter step gets canceled while on the ground Mario collides with a wall head-on with PU speed Miscellaneous behavior Certain objects and graphics behave interestingly while in parallel universes.

{"prompt": "Explain ROM Hacks", "completion": "See this page on Wikipedia ROM hacking  is the process of modifying a ROM of a game ( R ead- O nly  M emory dump, in other words a digital copy of the game) to alter the game's graphics, dialogue, levels, gameplay, and/or other elements. This is usually done by technically inclined video game fans to breathe new life into a cherished old game, as a creative outlet, or to make essentially new unofficial games using the old game's engine. ROM hacking is generally accomplished through the use of a hex editor (a program for editing non-textual data) and various specialized tools such as tile editors, and game-specific tools which are generally used for editing levels, items, and the like, although more advanced tools such as assemblers and debuggers are occasionally used. In the Super Mario 64 community, ROM hacks are fangames of the original game, allowing for a new experience in a new story, with characters, abilities, or a range of other attributes defined by the game's author. Some ROM hacks are simple reskins, whereas others are entirely new games. ROM hacks are also used to visualize game information better, and are used with challenges such as the  A Button Challenge .

{"prompt": "Explain Grindel", "completion": "Grindel Technical Constants Object Group Surface Actor Group N/A Model ID 0x36 Draw Distance 4000 Physical Constants Gravity -400 Friction 1000 Buoyancy 200 Code Initialization Behavior Script   [1] Behavior Code   [2] Found in Shifting Sand Land Related Articles Thwomp ,  Spindel ,  Tox Box Grindel  is an enemy appearing inside the Pyramid in  Shifting Sand Land . It has two varieties: a vertically moving one which is identical to  Thwomp  in behavior and a horizontally moving one which jumps back and forth over a distance. Behavior The vertically moving Grindel shares the same behavior as the  Thwomp , moving up, staying in the air, moving down again and repeating. The horizontally moving Grindel uses different behavior. It moves forward as well as upward and turns around after jumping several times. This is done using the following procedure. The horizontal Grindel is initialized with its target yaw set to its moving angle yaw. If Grindel is not in the air, and Grindel\u2019s attributes have not already been updated to reflect that it is on the ground, then code is run to reflect that Grindel has just landed. In this code, a sound effect plays, Grindel\u2019s attributes are updated to reflect that it is on the ground, the camera shakes, Grindel\u2019s distance to its home is updated, and its forward velocity and timer are set to equal 0. If Grindel\u2019s target yaw is not equal to its current yaw, Grindel will rotate at 5.625 degrees per frame until it reaches its target yaw. During this process, Grindel\u2019s timer attribute is set to 0 continuously. This is what is run to turn Grindel around over the course of 32 frames. 60 frames after the target yaw has been reached, if Grindel is more than 300 units from its home, Grindel\u2019s target yaw is increased by 180 degrees, and Grindel\u2019s distance to its home is set to 0, changing its home to its current position and causing it to begin turning toward its target yaw again. If Grindel is not more than 300 units from its home, Grindel\u2019s jumping action begins. In this action, a sound effect is played, Grindel\u2019s forward velocity is set to 11 units/frame, Gindel\u2019s Y-velocity is set to 70 units/frame, Grindel\u2019s gravity is set to -4, and Grindel\u2019s move flags attribute is set to 0. When Grindel is in the air, Grindel\u2019s attributes are updated to reflect that it has left the ground, and if Grindel\u2019s Y-velocity is less than 0, its gravity is set to -16. Overall, it takes 28 frames for Grindel to complete a full jump, its jump peaks at 648 units off the ground, and it moves forward a total of 308 units.

In order to trigger Bowser's text after defeating him, Mario must be within a short distance of him and face towards the center of his body. The \"whoosh\" sound that plays while spinning Bowser is not indicative of whether he is pointing towards a bomb; try to focus on aiming  visually . It is highly recommended that runners who play using an original Nintendo 64 controller switch to a different controller for Bowser fights, as rapidly spinning the N64 controller's stick will wear it down. Recommended controllers include a Hori Mini Pad, a  Retro-Bit Tribute 64  or  Warrior64 , or a GameCube controller via a  Raphnet adapter .

{"prompt": "Explain List of unsolved glitches", "completion": "This article lists glitches whose cause has not been determined. Glitch Description Known Occurrences TTC Upwarp The TTC Upwarp glitch caused Mario to teleport from one of the TTC spinning platforms to near the ceiling of the platform above it. The glitch has only been documented one time and may be hardware related. \"TTC Upwarp Highlight\" by UncommentatedPannen TTC Push Block Downwarp One of the moving bars in TTC suddenly teleported downwards. The warp itself happened off-camera but the moving bar was in the wrong spot after. Since both this and the TTC upwarp involve objects having their Y-position change suddenly, the two may be related in some way. However, the same glitch has since occurred multiple times to the same person, along with several other strange glitches. It is now thought to simply be a problem with the runner's hardware, although the exact nature of the problem is unknown. \"weird teleporting thing\" by dumpdome64   \"mario\" by dupdome Sound Glitch Sound glitch is specifically a crash in the audio thread of the game, which will crash the game thread once the two attempt to sync (typically level loading). Most methods of crashing this way unexplained and only recently has the concept of the audio thread crashing become the understood major thing that connects all \"sound glitches.\" \"sound glitch in DW?\" by taihou64   \"Soundglitch on US?\" clipped by Menstilo   \"Super Mario 64 - Secrets In The Shallows & Sky 32\"43\" by Xiah7s   \"Super Mario 64: BitS No Sound Glitch (Non-TAS)\" by Rene   \"SM64 No Sound Death Glitch\" by Mitagi   \"sound glitch on BLJs\" by Racingman1   \"sound glitch (US)\" by Millnium Unexplained Crashes These are seemingly random crashes whose causes are unknown. \"MIPS Crash\"   \"WDW Crash\"   \"WF Crash\" DDD Submarine Emulator Crash The game sometimes crashes near the Submarine in DDD on emulator for unknown reasons. \"Submarine Crash by Lancerity\"   \"Submarine Crash by Galaxtic\"   \"Submarine Crash by Katun24\" Temporary Game Freeze The game briefly froze and then unfroze in these instances. A running theory for these issue is that it happens when the controller is plugged in, but not sending input ,which freezes the game as it waits to receive the input from the controller. This can apparently happen with third party controller or adapters [ citation needed ] \"RR Game Freeze\"   \"Bowser 1 Game Freeze\" BitFS elevator downwarp Mario was teleported downward from the BitFS elevator during a race, this glitch has only been documented once on the US N64 version of the game \"BitFS elevator downwarp\" Grand Star Downwarp Mario or the camera (The exact circumstances are contested) seemingly was downwarped when collecting the Grand Star, reported on J1.0 \"super mario 64 - 120 star speedrun\" by FrenchiestFry2 Solved glitches This is a list  of glitches that once figured on this list, but have since been solved Glitch Description Known occurences BitDW Spawning Displacement This is an example of  Reverse Spawning Displacement , by creating dust in the basement and entering the lobby, it is possible to segment the memory of the object bank and load the trapdoor in a different memory slot.

Two Ukikis appear in TTM; one near the  Rolling Log  and the  Fly Guy , and the other (which doesn't appear in  Scale the Mountain ) at the top of the mountain. The lower one will run towards Mario and \"steal\" and wear  Mario's cap  when first picked up, and run away from him (with the same behavior as the higher Ukiki) after taking the cap. Mario can get his cap back by catching the Ukiki again. The higher one, generally referred to simply as \"Ukiki\" since it is more important, runs away from Mario, and when caught will open the  Monkey Cage  and spawn the  Mystery of the Monkey Cage  star. Glitches Ukikispeedia When Ukiki is running away from Mario on the ground, his speed is set to 90% of Mario's speed, with a minimum cap but no maximum cap [1] . This means that if Mario has forward  hyperspeed , Ukiki will gain hyperspeed as well. This glitch has applications to the  B Button Challenge , and was named after Ukikipedia.

It consists of a room fully filled with water; it contains 40  yellow coins  that can be used to refresh Mario's air. There are also 8  red coins  that must be collected to spawn a star. It is the only stage to have an (albeit implicit) time limit, as you cannot resurface and there are a limited amount of coins you can use to refresh your air. Contents 1   A Presses 2   Other Challenges 3   Coins 4   References A Presses Although the stage itself does not require any A presses, as it can easily be done by swimming with the B button, entering the aquarium is a challenge on its own. The current strategy used is very complicated. Because the final  text redirection  is done using a door that requires 1 star, the whole strat has to be done without collecting a single star. We have to enter  Bowser in the Dark World , get the basement key, and go to  Shifting Sand Land . Once in there, the TAS creates a setup using various objects found in the course to make sure Mario gets the right angle and speed for the lobby movement. [1] Other Challenges This star cannot be collected in the  Coinless Challenge ,  CCC Challenge ,  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , or  UBER Challenge , as it requires collecting red coins and swimming. This star can be collected in the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge ,  Pacifist Challenge ,  B Button Challenge ,  Z Button Challenge , and  Floor is Lava Challenge .

When Mario interacts with its hitbox, the coin counter is incremented by 5 instantly, which appears over time in the coin count because it only updates every other frame. Mario's integral  HP  is also increased by 5 gradually. The coin loads some  Coin Twinkles  and then unloads. Spawn Criteria These coins can spawn in one of three ways. Certain enemies spawn Blue Coins upon death, like  Medium Piranha Plants  such as those in  Whomp's Fortress ,  Mr. I 's, and  Beach  or  Shellless Koopas . Blue Coins are also spawned by  Ground Pounding  or twirling into a  Big Goomba , but not by killing it any other way, and by killing the head of a  Pokey . Oddly, upon breaking a  Crazy Box  or throwing a  Chuckya , five Yellow Coins are spawned rather than a Blue Coin, even though both would increment the coin counter by the same amount. When Ground Pounding a  Blue Coin Block , a set number of Blue Coins will appear for a limited amount of time. If collected before the timer runs out, the coins and block will be unloaded. Before the block is Ground Pounded, the blue coins are loaded, but invisible and intangible. When sliding down the  Cool, Cool Mountain  slide, including during the  Big Penguin Race  mission, and sliding down the  Tall, Tall Mountain  slide. These blue coins act differently from other blue coins. They slide down the slide similarly to how Mario does, and bounce a little. Blue Coin Clones Although it has been possible to clone Blue Coins since the basics of  cloning  and  handsfree holding  were discovered, it was thought impossible to clone them productively; that is, to collect more coins than normally possible by cloning them [1] . However, it was discovered that by quickly getting to a  loading zone , which is only possible in  Wet-Dry World [2] , the coin could be both cloned and recollected. Originally, it was thought that the only way to reach the loading zone in time was to use an  Overflow Jump , which required visiting  Parallel Universes  to do. However, it was later found that it can be done using only a moderate amount of speed via a  negative-height jump [3] .

The penguin is not present to challenge Mario at sliding. Version 2 : Accessed by selecting Star 2, 3, 4, and 6. The penguin is present, challenging Mario to the race. Version 3 : Accessed by selecting Star 5. This version is identical to Version 2 except that the snowman's body is present to allow Mario to bring it down to meet its head. Additionally, the penguin will become a fat penguin once 120 stars are collected. Coins The coin placement in this course is unique, with how half of the coins are in the main area, and half are in the slide. If all of the coins are collected, a maximum of 154 coins are collectible. There is a theoretical way to raise this maximum - with the use of penguin  Time Stop , you could collect coins and then enter the chimney to get infinite coins. However, no method has been successful in getting Mario to the chimney, and the max height reached is only near the blue coin block.

Slip Slidin' Away  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/vqbq-yeLWbI   Since Mario already starts out at higher grounds of the course, and there are teleporters available to teleport Mario back to the top, this star presents no issues. That being said, frame-walking or dive grinding is required to get up a slope to reach the chimney that leads to the slide. Once exiting out the slide, the star is reachable with a precise dive recover (the star is only 257 units above ground [2] ). Li'l Penguin Lost  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/oXAjWluPjho   Mario frame-walks or dive grinding up the slope to reach where the little penguin is. He then grabs it, sliding down the mountain to give the baby back to mother penguin. The rewarded star is above the maximum height that a dive recover can reach (288 units), and thus, Mario needs to use vertical wind or teleport all the way back to the top and drop down from above to collect the star. Big Penguin Race  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/TQMbgDeAMRU   Enter the slide in the same fashion done in Star 1, and then beat the penguin in the race. Afterwards, collect the star. Frosty Slide for 8 Red Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/XH2exVpK6EI   Seven of the eight red coins require no tricky techniques, but the one at the top of the ski lift is a bit more difficult as the walls around the platform are too high to dive recover onto. There are a few different ways to collect it, with the original one being to activate the ski lift, quickly warp back to the top of the stage, collect the red coin, and land back on the ski lift as its moving down. It is also possible to collect it and survive using a precise ledge grab, a slide kick bounce, or a misalignment. Snowman's Lost His Head  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/t_ETEIo3fvs   With the convenient slope located in the beginning, Mario can reach the Snowman's body and help it roll down the mountain to reach its head with Mario's guidance. While the star is too high to reach without jumping, there is a Spindrift nearby to provide the necessary height to reach it. Wall Kicks Will Work  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/NnC5n70j1KE   The main trick is landing on a  Spindrift  to activate twirling, then use a specific trajectory with a high speed to reach the star from above to bypass the need to long jump or wall kick. While the maximum speed of twirling is 31, Pannenkoek found a way to twirl faster than that. It is done by  not  steering Mario most of the time to conserve the high speed achieved by sliding down from the tiptop of the mountain, where it is reached by frame-walking. CCM 100 Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/jWjQ0Bwbbxk   By collecting the coins in the big slide (where there are 72 coins) and sliding down the outer slide of the mountain, Mario would gather enough coins to spawn the 100 coin star. Other challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected in isolation, with  Slip Slidin' Away  and  Big Penguin Race  requiring a clip with the baby penguin to enter the slide.  Snowman's Lost His Head  cannot be collected in a full-game run, since the red coin star must be completed first. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  Slip Slidin' Away ,  Frosty Slide for 8 Red Coins ,  Wall Kicks Will Work , and  100 Coins  can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge ,  Li'l Penguin Lost ,  Frosty Slide for 8 Red Coins ,  Snowman's Lost His Head , and  100 Coins  can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses.  Li'l Penguin Lost  requires leading the baby penguin to the vertical wind. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Slip Slidin' Away  and  Wall Kicks Will Work  can be collected. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: getting more coins than intended, reaching a  Parallel Universe  from both areas of the level, grabbing the second baby penguin without pressing B, and getting hurt by a penguin. Trivia Cool, Cool Mountain was the first main course to be completed entirely in 0 A presses, being completely solved in 2011.

This can be used to skip the door opening animation for two doors during this star. This glitch is patched on the US and Shindou releases of game, meaning that Door Skip is not possible on these versions. Due to it being patched, however, it is much easier to perform a glitch called Text Skip in the final Boo room on these versions. This glitch skips the text box of the last Boo you kill, meaning you only have to scroll through one text box rather than two. This glitch is also possible on the JP version of the game, however due to the properties of Time Stop on this version it is significantly more difficult to perform.

The main theme of this course is a clock. This level's core focus is in platforming with variable part movement in the clock. Like  Rainbow Ride  and other open air courses, Mario can fall into the  death barrier  at any time, from any height. Contents 1   Clock Settings 2   Upwarp 3   Coins 4   A Press Counts 4.1   Spawning Displacement A Press Saves 5   Other Challenges 6   Trivia 7   References Clock Settings   The possible clock settings and their required angles. Tick Tock Clock has four clock settings. Each one depends on the position of the  minute hand  of the clock  painting  when Mario enters it. The clock settings are still, slow, fast, and random. Each clock setting affects the behavior of the moving  objects  within Tick Tock Clock, detailed under their specific object pages. Specifically, the following objects take into account the clock setting: Spinners Cogs Rotating blocks Moving bars Pendulums Elevators Treadmills In general: On the still setting, moving and rotating platforms do not attempt to move. The  Thwomp , however, still moves.  Pedro spots  are common on this setting. This setting was once used for the  A Button Challenge  because of a specific Pedro spot on the  cogs . On the slow setting, moving and rotating platforms move slowly. On the fast setting, moving and rotating platforms move quickly. Using  Vertical Speed Conservation  on an  elevator , the most vertical speed can be stored on the fast setting compared to other settings. On the random setting, most objects call  RNG  to determine their movement. This setting is used for the A Button Challenge, the  ABZ Button Challenge , the  Buttonless Challenge , and many more because of its potential for manipulation. On this setting, there is potential for  squish cancel  on the  moving bars  and  pendulums , and  pendulum manipulation  is also possible. There is a Pedro spot on a certain  pendulum box  that saved 3 A presses on  Stomp on the Thwomp [1]  that exists on every setting, but it is only possible to enter it with pendulum manipulation on the random setting. [2] Upwarp See also:  History Of The TTC Upwarp ,  List of Unsolved Glitches In 2013, speedrunner DOTA_Teabag managed to capture an  upwarp  glitch during a speedrun race with MidBoss. 2 years later, due to the inability to replicate this upwarp,  pannenkoek2012  placed a US$1,000 bounty for anyone who could replicate and record the upwarp in  Mupen64 [3] . The bounty has not yet been claimed, and the upwarp has yet to be replicated. However, in May of 2020, a runner named dumpdome64 ran into a similar glitch while practicing the Tick Tock Clock 100 Coin Star route. [4]  While practicing, a push block from high in the course suddenly appeared much lower in the course, at a Y-position close to 0. In addition, Mario's shadow became glitched for 1 frame at several points later on. Preliminary analysis suggests that all of these glitches were the result of a single bit being changed for 1 frame and a connection between these and the upwarp is possible. Coins There are 128 coins naturally in the course. With  cloning , it is possible to clone 127 extra coins to bring the coin count to 255, or clone 151 coins to bring the coin count to 279 coins before the game crashes due to object slots. Location Count 10 coins in\u00a0! block behind start with spinning heart 10 2 coins above first turning cube 2 3 coins in\u00a0! block behind second pendulum 3 3 coins in\u00a0! block by the first moving hand 3 Slanted line of coins beside the first pole (with amp) 5 3 coins in each\u00a0! block with Heave Ho (there are 2 blocks) 6 3 coins in\u00a0! block on top of \"Timed Jumps on Moving Bars\" star 3 10 coins in\u00a0! block above the 4 \"block pushers\" in a row 10 3 coins in\u00a0! block, on main path, just past 3 spinning platforms 3 10 coins in\u00a0! block underneath the Thwomp 10 10 coins in the first\u00a0! block at the very top of the clock 10 10 coins in\u00a0! block on the middle platform (drop from very top) 10 2 Bob-ombs 2 8 Red Coins 16 7 Blue coins from block (by \"The Pit and the Pendulums\" star) 35 Total 128 A Press Counts There are no A presses needed inside TTC in the  A Button Challenge . It should be noted that it requires 1x A press to enter TTC, which is repeated three times. Spawning Displacement A Press Saves Mario can collect  Stop Time for Red Coins  on a  spinner  by  cloning  it. He can also collect both  The Pit and the Pendulums  and  Get a Hand [5]  on a spinner by  kicking  a  wall  as he collects them, allowing him to keep that momentum and fall across the course, landing on a spinner down below. These spinners can be used on the random setting to provide  spawning displacement  that allows Mario to spawn back on top of the clock, which saves 1 A press each time it is used [6] . Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  Get a Hand  and  Stop Time for Red Coins  can be collected. The former requires  Pendulum Manipulation  to reach the star. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , every star except for  Stomp on the Thwomp  and  100 Coins  can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses.  100 Coins  requires coin cloning to avoid ground pounding the  Blue Coin  block. In the  UBER Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: getting infinite coins and reaching a  Parallel Universe . Trivia Tick Tock Clock holds the distinction of having a shorter draw distance for objects compared to the other courses. The default draw distance for objects in Tick Tock Clock is 2000 units, half of the game's regular 4000 units.

{"prompt": "Explain Bomp", "completion": "Bomp Technical Constants Object Group Surface Model ID 0xAE (Small)   0xB1 (Large) Hitbox Damage 0 Health NA Code Initialization Behavior Script   [1] Behavior Code   [2] Bomp  is an enemy that appears in  Whomp's Fortress . They come in small and large varieties. Exactly 3 appear in the game, all in Whomp's Fortress. One of these is large and the other two are small. Behavior When Small Bomp is initialized, its facing angle is decreased by 90 degrees and its initial position is set equal to its current position. Small Bomp\u2019s timer attribute is set by multiplying a random float from 0 to 1 by 100. Bomp has four actions: waiting, poking out, extending, and retracting. When Bomp is in the waiting action, Bomp does nothing until Bomp\u2019s timer reaches a value of at least 101. When this happens, Bomp\u2019s action is set to poking out and its forward velocity is set to 30 units/frame. When Bomp is in the poking out action, Bomp continues moving forward until Bomp\u2019s X-position is greater than 3450. At this point, Bomp\u2019s X-position is set to 3450 and its forward velocity is set to 0. Separately, after an additional 15 frames from poking out, Bomp\u2019s action is set to extending, its forward velocity is set to 40 units/frame, and a sound is played. When Bomp is in the extending action, Bomp moves forward until its X-position is greater than 3830. At this point, Bomp\u2019s X-position is set to 3830 and its forward velocity is set to 0. Separately, after an additional 60 frames from extending being set, Bomp\u2019s action is set to retracting, Bomp\u2019s forward velocity is set to 10 units/frame, a sound plays, and Bomp\u2019s moving angle is decreased by 180 degrees. When Bomp is in the retracting action, Bomp continues moving backwards until its X-position is less than 3330. At this point, Bomp\u2019s X-position is set to 3330 and its forward velocity is set to 0. Separately, after an additional 90 frames from retracting being set, Bomp\u2019s action is set to poking out, its forward velocity is set to 25 units/frame, and its moving angle is decreased by 180 degrees. Large Bomp\u2019s behavior uses the same loop of actions as Small Bomp. However, when it is initialized, its move angle is increased by 90 degrees rather than its facing angle being decreased by 90 degrees and it does not set its initial position to its current position.

Needless to say this cannot happen in vanilla SM64 because Bubba is not in a level with quicksand.

Basically it cannot be cancelled into any other action, except for the quicksand death mentioned earlier. Note that Mario can't escape from this action by interacting with an object either, since this action has the \"intangible\" flag.

{"prompt": "Explain Pause Buffering", "completion": "Pause buffering  is a technique characterized by strategically pausing to cause unusual effects during in-game (unpaused)  frames . Note that the process of pausing and unpausing in and of itself takes at least three frames, so typical pause buffering means that the game is being played at quarter-speed. Please note that pause buffering in SM64 is totally different from buffering inputs in OOT and similar games; inputs made on the pause screen cannot be carried over into the actual game. Contents 1   Applications 1.1   Pause Buffering Inputs 1.2   Pause Buffering the Global Timer 1.2.1   Pause Buffered Hitstun Applications Pause buffering can be used to press inputs on two or more in-game-contiguous frames. As  Super Mario 64  runs at 30 frames per second, a player can theoretically input a button press up to a maximum of 15 times per second. The button input needs to be released for a single frame before it can be pressed again. Pause buffering allows you to input button presses at a higher rate since the game world is frozen while inputs are still polled. These extra button presses come at the cost of time lost transitioning between the pause menu and gameplay. Pause Buffering Inputs In situations where it would be advantageous to press the same button for two frames in a row, those two in-game frames can be separated by opening the pause menu. This provides time for the game to recognize the release of the button, and be able to detect another press once the game is unpaused. In short, pausing allows an input to be released and pressed again without changing any in-game states. For example, a  dive  can be followed immediately by a  dive recover , which is useful while holding an object  handsfree  in the  A Button Challenge  (ABC). Notably, pause buffering is not necessary to perform this in a non-ABC setting, since B can be pressed to dive followed by A to recover. Pause Buffering the Global Timer The  global timer  is a variable that increments every frame, even paused frames. Thus,  objects  that depend on the global timer can be manipulated by strategically pausing. Although many objects use the global timer, the ones that are most commonly manipulated are  Swoopers  and the  Lethal Lava Land   drawbridge . Many objects use their own timer instead of the global timer, and since objects do not update while paused, cannot be affected by pause buffering. Pause Buffered Hitstun The most common use of pause buffering the global timer is Pause Buffered Hitstun, which lends itself to  HOLP  preservation and thus releasing objects remotely. The player can avoid updating the HOLP by taking advantage of  Mario 's blinking effect after  hitstun , an effect that continues if Mario is inside an enemy  hurtbox . After being hurt in any way but small fall damage, Mario, along with a held  ticket , will become transparent on every second frame. His opacity depends on the parity of the global timer, so he is not rendered on odd frames. Since the global timer is incremented on every frame, including paused frames, by pausing for the minimum three frames and unpausing for the minimum one frame when the timer is odd, Mario and the ticket will effectively not render until the blinking effect stops. Because the ticket does not need to render, the HOLP is not updated during that time. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp"}

What do I do? How do I TAS? Basic Mupen64 TAS Tutorial What is STROOP? Main article:  STROOP STROOP ( S uperMario64  T echnical  R untime  O bserver and  O bject  P rocessor) is a diagnostic tool for Super Mario 64 which displays and allows for simple editing of various game values and information. It can connect to a running emulator and update values in real time. Some core features include views of loaded/unloaded objects, Mario structure variables, camera + HUD values, an overhead map display, and many more. What is Mupen? Main article:  Mupen64 Mupen64 (Mupen for short) is an N64 emulator. A variant of Mupen64, Mupen64-rr, is most commonly used for TASing Super Mario 64. This is what most people in the TAS community mean when they say \"Mupen\". There is also an emulator known as Mupen64Plus, which does not have TASing capabilities, but is commonly used for  RTA . Why Mupen over BizHawk? Most TASes of Super Mario 64 are done on  Mupen64-rr . This is for one main reason: .m64 files can be played back on console, known as  Console Verification , whereas bk2 files cannot, due to the way they handle input during lag frames. BizHawk polls inputs on lag frames, as opposed to Mupen64, which does not, and SM64 doesn't either. BK2 files (BizHawk movie files) can still be converted to m64 files, however, so some still use Bizhawk. Where can I get an SM64 ROM? A quick google search can help you with that. Unfortunately we cannot provide links here because of copyright. What different challenges are there? As of now, there are 13 challenges that have gained decent popularity, along with many minor ones. Some of the more well-known include: The  UBER Challenge The  Pacifist Challenge The  A Button Challenge The  B Button Challenge The  Z Button Challenge The  Coinless Challenge The  Capless/Cannonless Challenge The  CCC Challenge The  ABZ Button Challenge The  Low Doors Challenge The  No Joystick Allowed Challenge The  Floor is Lava Challenge The  Same Input Challenge See the  Challenge  and  Other Single Button Challenges  pages for further info on these and others. How many A presses are left? An any% run takes 0 A presses when performed on Wii VC. A 120 star run currently takes 13 A presses when performed on the original Japanese N64 version. Here's a table showing these counts on all game versions: N64\u00a0JP (Original) N64\u00a0US N64\u00a0PAL N64\u00a0JP (Shindou) iQue Wii\u00a0VC JP Wii\u00a0VC US Wii\u00a0VC PAL Wii\u00a0U\u00a0VC JP Wii\u00a0U\u00a0VC US Wii\u00a0U\u00a0VC PAL 64DD Version Any% 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 120\u00a0Star 13 16 16 17 17 16 15 15 17 16 16 Impossible Is a 70 Star 0 A press run being developed? Yes; though it is not yet confirmed to be possible, the run is being TASed until  BitFS . This is because we have a good blueprint for how to do BitFS on the N64. There is currently no plan to make a 70 star no A press run on  Wii VC  because  verifying these runs  is difficult. What's the next A press save going to be? Currently, the next A press in line to be saved is Bowser in the Fire Sea on the N64, which would bring the A press count from 13 to 12, using  Bully Battery  and a  Squish Cancel  combined together. How are you decompiling the game? After we discovered the compiler that Nintendo used for Super Mario 64, we obtained the raw assembly from the ROM, and reverse engineered C code that compiles into it. This was a long and tedious process, but after a couple years, the game has been fully decompiled. Why does Mario lose his hat when he dies from going out-of-bounds (OoB)? Mario's default state is, surprisingly, with no hat on, and on each frame it checks whether he's wearing the hat and sets the proper graphics flag. However, when Mario goes OoB, a large portion of the central Mario code stops running, including that check. Hence, Mario doesn't actually lose his hat; he just forgets he's wearing it. I just got through the 8 Star Door to Bowser 1 by grabbing onto it with a ledge grab! Is this useful? No. Clipping through the door with a ledge grab is a side effect of the patch in the SM64 Editor program that \"improves collision\". It is not actually possible in the original game. Mario's animation doesn't update when you dive recover against a wall. Is this useful? No. It is a purely visual glitch and has no effect on gameplay. I was doing a BLJ on the endless stairs and warped straight to Wet-Dry World. Is this new? No. You clipped through the wall and went above the painting. The game checks whether or not you entered paintings by checking whether or not you are above floor triangles behind them, even when you are really high up. Mupen How do you continue off of a TAS you created earlier? Play it to where you want to continue, then save a state. Disable read-only mode and reload the state. The file will now start recording inputs from that point, erasing any you had previously made after that point. Mupen is open, but the Mupen window disappeared and won\u2019t come back, even when I restart. What do I do? This is a glitch that occurs on old versions of Mupen when it is closed while minimized. To fix it, you must maximize the Mupen window and then drag down the top of the window, which will restore it to a normal window. To maximize the window without it actually being present, you can do one of the following: [Windows 7 Only] Open task manager, right click on the Mupen program, click maximize Right click on the Mupen icon in the task bar with shift held, click maximize Hover over the Mupen icon in the task bar, right click on the preview, click maximize Deleting Mupen\u2019s config file also works. Recording an AVI on mupen produces a blackscreen with sound. What do I do? This is a bug that occurs when you use the gl64 video plugin when aero is enabled on your computer. One fix is to use another video plugin, or to disable aero on your computer. The latter is only possible on Windows 7, but unfortunately not on later versions. The same bug can manifest when capturing with the \"Video\" synchronization mode on new versions of Mupen. Mupen's TAS Input Plugin window doesn't stay focused when clicking on the main emulator window. What do I do? This is a bug that was introduced in Windows 10 Version 1809, but has been patched in the latest versions of TASInput. Some solutions have been provided using macros, but the easiest solution is to simply click on the joystick area and hold the click outside of the tas input window. When you release the click it should still follow the mouse. Then click on Mupen, and from now until you close the rom, it will behave normally."}
{"prompt": "Explain Crash", "completion": "A  Crash ,  Freeze , or  Hardlock  is when the  game thread  of SM64 stops executing instructions (as opposed to a  softlock , where the game is still running as normal but is stuck in a loop without any way to get out). Crashes can occur in several different ways, such as a game thread exception or an  RCP  (graphics) crash. Contents 1   CPU Crashes 2   RCP (Graphics) Crashes 3   See Also 4   References CPU Crashes Cause Exception Type Notes Exceed the  object limit N/A This is technically not a crash as the game developers accounted for this scenario and made the game enter an infinite loop. However, this infinite loop has the same symptoms as a crash and is one for all practical purposes, so it is included here. This \"crash\" can be done via a variety of methods including cloning, hat duplication, monty-mole pellet build-up, or money-bag duplication. Sending the camera into a  PU Floating-Point Overflow Walking at PU speed for only a portion of the 4 quarter steps on a  frame Floating-Point Overflow Moving at PU speed with no joystick input for all 4 quarter steps on a frame Floating-Point Overflow Moving 16384 distance into a wall (Often a PU Crash) Floating-Point Overflow Walking with a speed greater than or equal to 2^31 / 170 (~12.632M) Floating-Point Overflow Mario's speed is multiplied by 170 in some intermediate calculations and casted to an int. When this cast exceeds 2^31 an FPE occurs. Turning during a walking action such that speed times change in yaw is greater than or equal to 2^31 * 12 (~12.583M with dyaw = 2048) Floating-Point Overflow Similar to the above. Bully Knockback Division-by-Zero Floating-Point Division-by-Zero By positioning Mario at the exact same X and Z coordinates as the bully, a division-by-zero exception occurs when the game divides by the lateral distance between Mario and the bully to calculate Mario and the bully's new speed after the collision. [1] Bully/Bob-omb Angle Overflow Floating-Point Overflow When a Bully or Bob-omb is out-of-bounds, the code to keep their angle between -32768 and 32767 doesn't run, and eventually it becomes big enough that a floating-point overflow exception occurs when casted back to an int. [2] [3] Deleting a non-existent file on the File Select Screen [4] Address Error The game tries to find the button object corresponding to the file and set its state to erased. However, the button object doesn't exist (a New File button is there instead), so it ends up trying to write to NULL. Moving a shadow above  surface  12 while it's over OOB Address Error The surface SURFACE_INTANGIBLE (surface 12) has the special property that in some cases find_floor will look for floors below an intangible surface if it finds one. If there's no floor below the intangible surface, find_floor will return NULL for the found floor but the height of the intangible floor. As floors are null-checked by checking if their height is the default value of -11000, this will cause a NULL dereference the next time the game tries to use the floor variable. Killing a Monty Mole remotely Address Error The game tries to find which hole the Monty Mole should spawn in, but all the available holes are too far away from Mario, so no hole is chosen and the Monty Mole tries to go to a null hole. [5] Killing an uninitialized Monty Mole [6] Address Error Similar to above. Going out of bounds in a room with a painting Address Error Paintings use the floor type of Mario's floor to decide how they should ripple. Going out-of-bounds causes them to try to read the floor type of null. Being pushed off of a hangable  ceiling  while hanging and stationary without another ceiling above Address Error The game has a check to make Mario enter freefall if the ceiling above him is not hangable. The programmers failed to account for the ceiling being NULL, so if Mario is pushed off the ceiling and has no ceiling above him the game will try to read the type of a null ceiling and crash. Sound glitch Unknown \"Sound glitch\" refers to when the audio thread encounters an exception (usually an address error exception), therefore causing the sound to cut out. When the game thread next tries to interface with the audio thread on a level load, the game thread crashes as well. Sound glitch is often treated as one singular glitch even though it is really a class of glitches in the audio library. Sound glitches are usually J-exclusive, however some instances such as the  BitS  sound glitch are not. Teleporting while passing over a loading zone Address Error Since the area changed, there is now no teleporter with the same ID as the one Mario used to warp. Thus the game returns NULL when trying to find an associated warp node to warp to, and crashes when trying to access information about its destination. Under certain conditions, this can cause a Wrong Warp on PAL or Shindou VC. Warping out of a level while passing over a loading zone Address Error Similar to above, but only hypothetical. Maybe possible in DDD using the Sub Gate warp and whirlpool cloning to reach the instant loading zone, but not yet achieved without hacks. Entering Wiggler's Cave on the Disk Drive version Floating-Point Unimplemented Operation When Wiggler is initialized, his health value is 2048 for a single frame before being reset to 4. Wiggler uses his health to index into a table to get his speed (to move faster when at lower health); 2048 causes it to index out of range and read a denormalized floating-point number as his health, which causes an unimplemented operation exception since the N64 does not implement any operations on denormalized floats except comparisons. Having an object too far away from the camera make a noise (JP only) Floating-Point Unimplemented Operation When a noise's pan is determined, it uses the position of the object to calculate the pan. When the object's absolute z-position relative to the camera is large (>= 22000 units) and the x-position relative to the camera is very negative (< -66000), an index for the pan will be generated outside of the bounds of the array for the pan. When the value outside of the array is an invalid float, the audio thread will crash (sound glitch). Does not happen when sound mode is set to Mono. Casting a shadow on a corrupted triangle Floating-Point Unimplemented Operation The limit of surface triangle loaded at once in the game is 2300. However, in  Hazy Maze Cave , when using  Mario's Platform Adventure , it is possible to load more triangle than this limit. This causes the surfaceList to overwrite part of the face table. If the game tries to cast a shadow on one of the \"triangles\" created by this situation, the normalX of the triangle will be a pointer and be processed as a denormalized float, which crashes the game when used for arithmethic. [7] Having the same position as the camera's position Floating-Point Division-by-Zero When Mario stands in the same position as the camera, the game will crash due to a division by zero error. [8] Rotating a Pendulum using pendulum manipulation beyond the float angle limit. Floating-Point Overflow Manipulating the pendulum to rotate beyond the range of an int will error when truncating the float. Verification of this crash took 39 days. [9] Touching a recovery heart with more than ~10.7M speed. Floating-Point Overflow Touching a recovery heart with more than ~10.7M speed will cause float-to-int conversion with a float value that's greater than the max integer value. [10] RCP (Graphics) Crashes Cause Exception Type Notes Have too many 3D models on screen at once Invalid F3D command The main display list buffer has two sides, the left side holds F3D commands the game runs, and the right side holds allocated buffers for matrices. When an object's graphics are drawn, 16 bytes are used from the left side and 64 from the right side for each separate 3D model from the object. These two sides overlap when there are too many of these models on screen, leading to both sides being overwritten with garbage data and invalid F3D commands. Moving the camera immediately when entering  VCutM Invalid F3D command The object that spawns the rotating checkerboard platforms in VCutM references a model that doesn't exist. Normally this isn't a problem, since it's not on screen so it's culled before any damage occurs, and it despawns 1 frame after loading the level. However rotating the camera on the first frame, right before it despawns, it just barely comes into view. The non-existent model ends up sending invalid F3D commands to the RCP.

When Mario is within 600 units of Whomp King, the level music volume is reduced by 40% and Whomp King begins his dialogue then begins the fight. Whomp King moves with an initial speed of 3 units/frame and rotates toward Mario at 2.8125 degrees/frame. After 30 frames, if Mario is within 45 degrees of Whomp King's sight and less than 1500 units from Whomp King's position, Whomp King will begin moving with a forward speed of 9 units/frame while still turning toward Mario. If Mario is within 300 units of Whomp King's position, Whomp King with jump and land in the exact same manner as a regular Whomp. If Mario ground pounds Whomp King while he is down, Whomp King's health is decreased by 1, sounds play, and particles spawn. Then, Whomp King's y-position oscillates up and down by 8 units for 10 frames and then Whomp King begins to rise back up. Otherwise, Whomp King will stay down for 100 frames if he did not squish Mario and 30 frames if he did squish Mario before rising back up and returning to his initial pattern of chasing Mario. Once Whomp King's health reaches 0, Whomp King gives his defeat dialogue and then becomes invisible and intangible before spawning particles and a star.  v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Objects Enemies Regular Amp  \u2022  Bob-omb  \u2022  Boo  \u2022  Bookend  \u2022  Bomp  \u2022  Bub   \u2022  Bubba  \u2022  Bullet Bill  \u2022  Bully  \u2022  Chain Chomp  \u2022  Chuckya  \u2022  Fly Guy  \u2022  Goomba  \u2022  Grindel  \u2022  Haunted Chair  \u2022  Heave-Ho  \u2022  Klepto  \u2022  Koopa  \u2022  Lakitu  \u2022  Mad Piano  \u2022  Moneybag  \u2022  Monty Mole  \u2022  Mr. Blizzard  \u2022  Mr. I  \u2022  Piranha Plant  \u2022  Fire Piranha Plant  \u2022  Pokey  \u2022  Scuttlebug  \u2022  Skeeter  \u2022  Snufit  \u2022  Spindel  \u2022  Spindrift  \u2022  Spiny  \u2022  Sushi  \u2022  Swoop  \u2022  Thwomp  \u2022  Tox Box  \u2022  Unagi  \u2022  Whomp Bosses King Bob-omb  \u2022   Big Boo  \u2022   Big Bully  \u2022  Bowser  \u2022  Eyerok  \u2022  Manta Ray  \u2022  Whomp King  \u2022  Wiggler NPCs Bob-omb Buddy  \u2022  Koopa the Quick  \u2022  Penguin  \u2022  Hoot  \u2022  MIPS  \u2022  Toad  \u2022  Ukiki  \u2022  Yoshi Other Objects Common Yellow Coin  \u2022  Blue Coin  \u2022  Red Coin  \u2022  1-Up Mushroom  \u2022  Bowling Ball  \u2022  Cannon  \u2022  Power Star  \u2022  Seesaw platforms  \u2022  Wing Cap  \u2022  Vanish Cap  \u2022  Metal Cap  \u2022  Elevator  \u2022  Sign  \u2022  Wooden post  \u2022  Cork Box  \u2022  Crazy Box  \u2022  Teleporter  \u2022  Warp Pipe  \u2022  Secret Level Specific Big Boo's Haunt tilting platform  \u2022  Merry-Go-Round  \u2022  Treadmill  \u2022  Pendulum  \u2022  Spinner  \u2022  Bowser Bomb  \u2022  Bowser key  \u2022  Grand Star  \u2022  Lethal Lava Land Drawbridge  \u2022  Tilted Inverted Pyramid Platform  \u2022  BitDW Trapdoor  \u2022  Controllable Platform  \u2022  Boulder Unused Boo key  \u2022  Bowser Anchor  \u2022  Fish spawner  \u2022  Trampoline  \u2022"}

Keep in mind that if there are any blue stars (uncollected) present in the star selection menu, then the last version that can be selected is the first blue star and not the stars after it: Act 1 : This is the default act until Star 1 is completed. The manta ray is not present. Act 2 : Accessed by selecting Star 2 through Star 6, but only after collecting  Board Bowser's Sub . The manta ray will appear. Additionally, Bowser's submarine will disappear after Bowser in the Fire Sea is completed, replaced by several moving poles across the ceiling of the course. Tips You need to do 100 before completing  Bowser in the Fire Sea  since the sub is used to grab the red coins in RTA.

It appears in multiple main courses and in  Wing Mario Over the Rainbow Description The Cannon is an obejct made of three parts\u00a0: The cannon base, the cannon shaft (or barrel) and the cannon lid. When Mario first enters a level, only the cannon lid will be loaded, which is a surface Mario can walk on.

{"prompt": "Explain Yoshi", "completion": "Yoshi Hitbox Info Hitbox Tangibility radius 1000 Interaction type Text Found In Castle Grounds Yoshi  is a minor character that appears on top of the castle after you have collected all 120 stars. After you talk to him, he will give you 100 lives and the  special triple jump , then jump off of the roof and disappear. Contents 1   Behavior 2   Glitches 2.1   Lives Softlock 2.2   Yoshi Walks off the Roof 3   References Behavior Yoshi has four possible homes with x,z coordinates of (0, -5625) (-1364, -5912) (-1403, -4609) (-1004, -5308). These homes do not have a y value as Yoshi is not intended to go off the flat part of the castle roof. Yoshi is initialized with a gravity value of 2.0, a friction value of 0.9 and Buoyancy of 1.3. Yoshi walks with a forward velocity of 10 units/frame. Yoshi\u2019s angle while walking approaches his target angle at 7.03125 degrees/frame. If Yoshi comes within 200 units of his home, Yoshi stops walking and idles. If Yoshi\u2019s Y-position is below 2100, Yoshi is deactivated and set to respawn. When Yoshi idles, after 91 frames Yoshi will randomly choose a new home. Yoshi\u2019s target angle is set to the inverse tangent of the difference between Yoshi\u2019s current position and his new home and Yoshi begins walking again. When Mario talks to Yoshi, Yoshi turns toward Mario at 7.03125 degrees/frame if he is not facing him, Yoshi\u2019s home is set to (-1364, -5912), and Yoshi is set to give Mario his present. When Yoshi gives Mario the present, Mario\u2019s life counter increases until it hits 100, Mario gets his special triple jump and Mario is set to jump off the roof. When Yoshi jumps off the roof, Yoshi walks toward the point (-1364, -5912). When Yoshi gets close to that point, his angle is set to face away from the roof, his forward velocity is set to 50 units/frame and his Y-velocity is 40 units/frame. Then, Yoshi\u2019s Y-velocity is decreased by 2 units/frame per frame and when his position is below 2100, the cutscene ends and Yoshi is deactivated. Glitches Lives Softlock On the Japanese version of the game only, there is a mistake in the code that will set Mario's lives to -25 if he reaches 1,000 coins. When you talk to Yoshi and he gives you 100 lives, he keeps increasing your life counter until it reaches 100. But if you have 1,000 or more coins while talking to Yoshi, then your lives will continually be reset to -25, which prevents them from ever reaching 100 and thus causing a  softlock [1] . This softlock was first documented by pannenkoek in a video uploaded on July 27th, 2016. Yoshi Walks off the Roof Yoshi is only intended to walk on the flat part of the castle roof. However, under some circumstances it is possible for Yoshi to accidentally walk onto the slanted part of the castle, which messes up his movement and causes him to walk off the edge of the castle. The programmers seemed to anticipate this, so they made Yoshi despawn the moment he falls off the roof and create a special \"Yoshi Respawner\" to respawn him if you go back to where he normally is. If you talk to Yoshi while he is starting to fall, then he will fall off the castle without unloading and try to walk to a specific location to jump and finish his cutscene. But he can never reach this location since he has fallen off, resulting in a softlock as Yoshi walks endlessly [2] . The first known mention of Yoshi falling off the castle was in a 2003 SM64 FAQ written by king kid, and the first video of the softlock was a 2007 video by Myles Bukrim.

{"prompt": "Explain Hat-in-Hand", "completion": "The  Hat-in-Hand  glitch is a glitch that causes Mario to hold his hat in his hand, as if he was stuck in his putting-on-a-cap animation. When holding objects in this state, the objects' models don't render, which means the  HOLP  will not update. Contents 1   Execution 2   Ending the Glitch 3   Side Effects 4   Use in Challenges 5   Availability 6   References Execution The hat in hand glitch is performed by picking up two or more caps in quick succession. The glitch works with duplicated normal caps as well as special caps. During the animation of putting on a cap, the hat appears in Mario's hand. If the animation is interrupted at the very end with picking up another cap, then Mario will not update to having the hat on his head instead of in his hand. Ending the Glitch Mario will put his hat back on after any textboxes (except for sign textboxes) or any cutscenes. The hat will also go back onto Mario's head if he leaves the course. Side Effects When Mario is holding his hat in his hand, it cannot be stolen by enemies. While holding his hat, Mario will take damage as if he was not wearing his hat. The  HOLP  will not update while Mario is holding his hat in his hand, since the hat is rendered in his hand and consequently the object is not rendered, which is required for updating the HOLP. Use in Challenges Due to its property of causing the HOLP not to update, the Hat in Hand glitch has been useful in some  challenges  such as the  A Button Challenge . Although it has often been obsoleted by  pause buffered hitstun , it's still required for  Mario Wings to the Sky  in 0 A presses and  Pole-Jumping for Red Coins  in 0.5 A presses. It's also the only way to place crazy boxes at a remote HOLP, which is used in the current fastest method for  Ride Big Boo's Merry-Go-Round  in 0 A presses. Availability The hat in hand glitch can be performed in the following courses. [1] Bob-omb Battlefield , using the  Wing Cap Whomp's Fortress , using the  Metal Cap Jolly Roger Bay , using the Metal Cap Big Boo's Haunt , using the  Vanish Cap Hazy Maze Cave , using the Metal Cap Shifting Sand Land , using the Wing Cap Dire, Dire Docks , using the Metal Cap or the Vanish Cap Snowman's Land  (outside the igloo), using a hat clone Snowman's Land (inside the igloo), using the Vanish Cap Wet-Dry World , using the Metal cap or the Vanish Cap Tall, Tall Mountain , using a hat clone Tower of the Wing Cap , using the Wing Cap Vanish Cap under the Moat , using the Vanish Cap Cavern of the Metal Cap , using the Metal Cap Wing Mario over the Rainbow , using the Wing Cap The glitch can only be done if the cap is close enough to the cap block when the block respawns, so it needs to be stopped by a wall. Seeing as there are no walls near the cap blocks in  Bowser in the Dark World  and  Lethal Lava Land , the glitch can't be done in these courses. Even though there are no walls near the metal cap block in Wet-Dry World, the glitch can still be done with that cap because it can be stopped by the water. This requires raising the water level exactly once, so it reaches above the cork boxes and submerges the cap.

Kicking while in the air prevents Mario from grabbing the pole until he lands. This makes it easy to strafe in the air and ensure you grab the coin. For the advanced movement (buffer kick \u2192 double jump \u2192 dive) to grab the coin, delay the buffered kick slightly so that Mario is closer to his peak double-jump height when you dive at the coin. This helps prevent grabbing the tree out of the dive. Expert Load video YouTube YouTube might collect personal data.

When they see Mario, their fuse lights and they start chasing him. After their fuse ends, they explode, creating an explosion object. Contents 1   Locations 2   Bloated Bob-omb 2.1   Maintaining a Bloated State 2.2   Hands-free Teleported Bloated Bob-omb 2.3   Uses 3   Interaction with walls 4   Supersaturated Bob-omb 5   See also 6   References Locations The following courses have Bob-ombs: Bob-omb Battlefield Shifting Sand Land Tall, Tall Mountain Tick Tock Clock Rainbow Ride Bowser in the Fire Sea Bowser in the Sky Bloated Bob-omb The bloated Bob-omb is the state when the Bob-omb gets bigger, right before exploding. Usually, this Bob-omb explodes. But if you grab it right before the explosion, it will be delayed for 12 frames. Note that if the explosion is early (by throwing the Bob-omb on the ground) It won't explode until the timer expires. The explosion is delayed, but the Bob-omb stays big, which means that its hitbox is bigger, enough to push Mario backwards. Maintaining a Bloated State After grabbing the bloated Bob-omb, you have to walk, then the Bob-omb will start exploding again, then you have to re-grab the Bob-omb. During these small frames of walking, you will be able to turn. Another way of keeping it is by holding it  Hands-free . You will be able to jump, jumpkick, double jump, triple jump, and ground pound. You can't turn except if you have a  Wing Cap , where you will be able to fly while being pushed backwards. Hands-free Teleported Bloated Bob-omb If you teleport while holding a Bob-omb  Hands-free , This Bob-omb will disappear. But if you go close to the first teleporter or if you teleport back, the Bob-omb will appear in front of you, giving you backwards momentum while keeping almost every movement. You can grab that Bob-omb by diving or punching. Kicking will cancel the momentum. Uses This trick is used frequently in the  A Button Challenge , but also generally for clipping through walls, such as in  the Chain Chomp's Gate clip. Interaction with walls The game first adds the speed to the current position and uses that point in the collision calculations. The algorithm will push the bob-omb outward from the wall if a collision occurs, so if it's already against the wall it effectively adds the component of the bob-omb's speed that's tangent to the wall. Regardless of whether a collision occurs or not, the Bob-omb's position is incremented by its speed at a later point as well. Finally, since the point used for the collision calculation is only written to the Bob-omb's position if a collision occurs, the double speed increment doesn't happen in the open field. This occurs before the Bob-omb's actual movement step, so then it moves a 2nd time before the frame ends. Thus, when Bob-ombs touch a wall, their speed is effectively doubled. Basically, Bob-ombs always check for wall collision before moving. If they do collide with a wall hitbox, then the Bob-omb's position is incremented and pushed away by the wall. Supersaturated Bob-omb A supersaturated Bob-omb is a Bob-omb whose fuse timer has overflowed, which vastly delays its explosion. Because the underlying glitch takes 828 days (2.3 years) to execute, it is the most time-consuming glitch in the game.

{"prompt": "Explain Thwomp", "completion": "Thwomp Technical Constants Object Group Surface Actor Group Group 1 Tangibility Radius 1000 Draw Distance 4000 Thwomp  is an enemy that appears in  Whomp's Fortress  and  Tick Tock Clock . Thwomps are large, blue, block-like enemies who \"attack\" by moving downwards, crushing Mario if he is beneath them. Mario can climb on them and is intended to use them to reach higher areas in some cases. A very similar enemy called  Grindel  appears in  Shifting Sand Land . Behavior When Thwomp\u2019s rising action begins, Thwomp begins to rise at a rate of 10 units/frame for 40 frames and then rises an additional 5 units and stops. Thwomp remains in the air for a variable period by calling for a random number between 0 and 1 which is then multiplied by 30 and added to 10. This is then used as the number of frames before Thwomp will move back down again. When this happens, Thwomp accelerates downward at a rate of 4 units/frame per frame. When Thwomp hits the ground, its Y-velocity is set to 0 and, if Mario is within 1500 units of Thwomp, the screen shakes and Thwomp makes a sound. After 10 frames, another random number from 0 to 1 is rolled and this number is multiplied by 10 and added to 20 to get the number of frames that Thwomp is on the ground before it begins to move up again.

{"prompt": "Explain Pedro Spot", "completion": "Pedro spots are geometric configurations in which a floor is vertically aligned and within 160 units of a ceiling. They must also be at least 1-2 units apart, depending on their position relative to the origin. Pedro spots have the unique property that by landing in one while in an air action, Mario's  Quarter step  is cancelled, yet he still technically \"lands\". This property leads to the fact that from a Pedro spot, Mario can both  jump  and  Ground Pound , a property that is not shared by other spots in the game. Pedro spots have found two important applications in the  A Button Challenge . When Mario lands in a Pedro spot, he never physically enters it. Instead, he stays positioned in the air next to it. This allows a form of  subframe grinding , allowing Mario to continue taking air steps while staying fixed in place. This can be used to build forward speed until Mario breaks out of the spot. The other main application of Pedro spots is Remote Lava Boost (RLB). When Mario lands while in the lava boost action, the game checks whether he is above a lava floor, and if so, boosts him again. If Mario lands in a Pedro spot while in the lava boost action, the game will consider him to have landed, and so will check the floor beneath Mario. However, because Mario is next to the Pedro spot and not in it, this floor may be far below Mario. This causes the game to trigger another lava boost without Mario touching lava. Another application of Pedro spots is that Mario can  downwarp . Pedro spots are very closely related to  Squish Cancel  spots. List of Pedro Spots Location How to enter Applicability The Castle There are two parallel spots on the main floor located in between the upstairs door and the 8-star door/PSS door. Both have no practical purpose. Cool, Cool Mountain Inside the cabin, just above the slide exit. This has no practical purpose, although it was the very first Pedro spot discovered. [1] Inside the cabin, between the top and bottom of the shortcut tunnel. It is only reachable if Mario has enough speed to completely bypass the cabin wall. This was used to collect the Impossible 1-up without dying [2] , although a much faster and simpler method has been found since then [3] . Tick Tock Clock In between the cogs shortly after the platform above the red coins. This can only be entered using a bob-omb. This was used for the 6xA and 5xA strategies for Stomp on the Thwomp in the ABC, but it was retired once a similar Pedro spot, also in TTC, was discovered [4] . In between the pendulum box and the ceiling near the blue coin switch. This can only be entered using pendulum manipulation and a bob-omb. This was used for the 3xA, 2xA, and 1xA strategies for Stomp on the Thwomp in the ABC, but it was retired when a method for climbing the clock 0xA was discovered [5] [6] . On the spinners, if they are rotated perfectly. It requires perfect RNG to work, as the spinner must stay still at a perfect angle. It was theorized that this could save A presses for several stars, but the extremely unlikely RNG made it impossible [7] . On the second pendulum when the clock parts are stopped. It was theorized that it could be used in the A Button Challenge to climb higher up the clock with the clock parts stopped, but it could not be used since the floor ran out before the ceiling did [8] . Rainbow Ride Between the two rectangular platforms underneath the  Tricky Triangles!  star, It can be used to collect  Somewhere Over the Rainbow  cannonless RTA, although other  faster TAS strategies were already known when it was discovered. [9] [10] . Vanish Cap under the Moat At the very top of the sloped wall separating the giant slope from the rest of the course. It can be used to press the Vanish Cap Switch in 0 A presses, but the misalignment strategy was already known and was faster [11] . This was also considered for building up speed to enter the  Secret Aquarium  in 0 A presses, but it was impossible to exit the stage while still retaining the speed [12] . Underneath the tilting platform on the back wall of the course. Used to significantly lower the time needed to enter the  Secret Aquarium  in 0 A presses. Bowser in the Fire Sea Between the sloped grate and the platform with the spinning heart on the bottom level. This spot can be used for Remote Lava Boost [13] . Between the collapsing ramps between the second and third levels. This spot can be used for Remote Lava Boost [13] . v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp \u2191   \"ayy (the Pedro Spot)\" by Plush \u2191   \"[TAS] SM64 - CCM 2nd Slide 1up Without Dying\" by PaLiX \u2191   \"No 3 hours of speed building required...\" by PaLiX \u2191   \"SM64 - Stomp on the Thwomp - 6x A Presses (Commentated) [OUTDATED]\" by pannenkoek2012 \u2191   TTC \"Pedro Spot on Pendulum Box\" by UncommentatedPannen \u2191   \"TTC Stomp on the Thwomp 3xA [OUTDATED]\" by UncommentatedPannen \u2191   \"\"Pedro\" (Hyperspeed) Spot in TTC w/ hacked platform angle\" by Tyler Kehne \u2191   \"TTC Pedro Spot using Pendulum\" by UncommentatedPannen \u2191   \"The Cool Way to Get to the Island in RR\" by UncommentatedPannen \u2191   \"SM64 RTABC Somewhere Over the Rainbow 1xA 15:20\" by Ivan178 \u2191   \"VCutM Alternative Cap Switch Press Strat using Pedro Spot\" by UncommentatedPannen \u2191   \"Enter the Secret Aquarium - 0x A Presses (Commentated)\" by bad_boot \u2191  13.0   13.1   \"Remote Lava Boost (RLB)\" by UncommentatedPannen"}

To complete it, Mario must collect the  Power Star  on the caged island floating in the sky by using the owl to drop down. The owl can be found in the first tree when selecting stars 3-6. It is possible to  jump directly there using precise movements .  Contents 1   A Button Challenge 2   TAS 2.1   TAS Strategy 2.2   TAS History 3   References A Button Challenge Mario first reaches the top of the course. He can get on the checkered elevator by walking up a slope and diving onto the elevator. One up, he triggers the bossfight with king whomp. Mario then lures king whomp to the edge of the area. He makes him faceplant at the right moment and location that Mario can perform a dive recover off of the checkered elevator near it\u2019s peak height, allowing for Mario to land on king whomp. He then climbs to the top as king whomp recovers. He then lures king whomp to the very edge of the area, so close that half his body is off the edge. He then performs a  pause dive recover  off king whomp. He performs a pause dive recover because sliding reduces mario\u2019s speed, so to maximise Mario\u2019s speed he needs to minimise his sliding time, and since both the dive and recover action is performed with B, he needs to pause buffer. This lands him in the cage, where he collects the  star .  TAS TAS Strategy Mario begins by doing a jump kick, and then positions himself to do 2 consecutive  long jumps , the second being on the elevated dirt path. He aims towards the stone corner, allowing for the  wall  hibox to push Mario to the right, reducing the distance Mario needs to travel. He then peforms  glitchy wall kick  to ascend to the ramp without changing his angle. Upon landing, Mario immediately performs 2 jump dives to maintain his speed. Maio then adjusts his angle to the left and performs another jump dive, landing on the small mesh fence. The wall hitbox moves Mario slightly to the right, which helps him with his angle. Mario recovers on the stairs, and slightly adjusts his angle to the left. He performs a kick at the last stair, and due to the elevation of the stair, he is on the ground the next frame, allowing him to instantly jump again. He wall kick dives onto the edge of the floating island and  grinds  along the edge in order to be able to  sideflip  faster. He sideflips and then does a wall kick, making him rise almost parrallel to the mesh wall. Once he's high enough, the inner wall snaps him into the cage. As soon as this happens, Mario dives, making him bonk into the wall infront of him. The bonk knocks Mario back, into the  star .

{"prompt": "Explain List of RTA Tricks", "completion": "This article is in need of an image. You can help Ukikipedia by  adding images . This article is a list of tricks and terms commonly used in speedrunning. Tutorials for these can be found in their respective  RTA Guides .

This is faster than ground pounding, and doesn't trigger a cutscene. Breezeless The term breezeless was coined from a new trick that was faster than an existing trick. In the mission  Mysterious Mountainside , the star is located in a hole. Players found out that Mario could skip the slide by jumping directly into the hole from above. The optimal route was to head left to the thin ledge, and use the breeze to get up, then jump down. Later, it was discovered that Mario could perform a  triple jump , wall kick and ground pound to reach the hole, which was faster than using the breeze. This new trick meant the breeze wasn't needed, hence the name. Cannonless   Demonstration of Cannonless in Whomp's Fortress   Ship Long Jump   Framewalk cannonless in Jolly Roger Bay Cannonless or \u201cCless\u201d for short is a term used for a speedrunning strategy that bypasses the need for a cannon. Whomp\u2019s Fortress In  Whomp\u2019s Fortress  players can get the star  Blast Away the Wall  by shooting out of the cannon and breaking the wall open, revealing the star. Players then found it was possible to clip into the wall by grabbing the ledge that the star rests on. A couple years later, there was a setup found that allowed the player to get the star consistently rather then blindly running at the wall. The no setup cannonless is called \u201cOG Canonless\u201d Then, another optimization was found that let the player look for a texture on the plank and use that instead dubbed \u201cTexture Setup\u201d. Jolly Roger Bay In  Jolly Roger Bay  the star  Blast to the Stone Pillar  is obtained by shooting out of a cannon and grabbing a pole and jumping onto a platform. Then, players realized you could shoot directly to the platform and skip grabbing the pole. If you shoot very quickly, you can get what is known as \u201cInsta-Shot\u201d. Players had another realization in the fact you can long jump off the ship and then wall kick to get to the star platform. Finally, it was found you can use  Frame Walking  to scale the stone pillar and get the star that way. The TAS uses a  Backwards Long Jump  to get up here. [1] Carpetless Carpetless is a trick in the star  The Big House in the Sky  which saves roughly 50 seconds off of the mission. [2]  For many years, it was unused, as its extreme difficulty made it seem unviable in a 120 star run. This trick in its first form which seemed possibly RTA viable was originally done in the  Shindou Edition 120 Star TAS . Mario first heads to the ship and grabs a bloated bob-omb. He then drops it at the platform on the other side of the plank. Mario then regrabs it while falling off the edge, causing the bob-omb's fuse to stop and for Mario to hold it hands free. He then navigates through the glass boxes, ground pounding to prevent him from walking. Once he reaches the warp, Mario the does 2 sideflips across the glass boxes and then sideflips to the castle wall, performs 2  glitchy wall kicks , and ground pounds, reaching the roof.  In mid 2015, 2 players, snowman and toadfan5, attempted to do this trick in real time using savestates. Eventually, toadfan successfully did it, making them the first to do carpetless RTA with the help of savestates. [3]  This achievement further implied that this trick could be done RTA. The first full completion of carpetless came in 2019, when Xiah was able to complete it after 2 weeks of grinding. [4]  This achievement re-ignited hope that this trick could one day be used in a 120 star run, but it still was deemed too difficult to perform. There have only been 5 people to ever do this trick using this method: Xiah, Mikko [5] , Shake [6] , TaylorSwiftSimp [7] , and Parsee [8] .  Parsee became remarkably consistent with carpetless, performing it many times, including in the first stage RTA world records with it [9] . Eventually, they believed carpetless may be viable for 120, and even got it after 10 minutes in a run [10] .  On Sept. 17th, 2023, a new RTA viable method for carpetless was found by the TASer Krithalith [11] . A setup\u2014based on timing several frame-perfect inputs\u2014was created for the current  BLJ less/Shindou TAS carpetless strategy, with a slight change. The strategy involves using the teleporter to get to the Big House, traveling up the blue glass blocks, and getting onto the House's window. Two  glitchy wall kicks  are then used to land onto one of the corner's spires, which can then be scaled by jumping up the slope from a buttslide. Krithalith realized that with a small range of angles, just holding right after the second glitchy wall kick will have Mario land uphill enough on the slope to be able to kick up it. This is much less precise, because it takes 5 frames to jump out of a buttslide, but a kick can happen immediately. The setup was very difficult, however many top runners were able to perform the setup. The setup seemed to many to have a real chance of being implemented in a 120 star world record. This became solidified with the \"Orthogonal Jones\" setup, released the following day [12] . The key factor that made this setup viable was use of only cardinal joystick angles, which have a range of joystick angles that all result in exactly straight angles, due to Super Mario 64's deadzone. The original setup used a perfect down-right diagonal, which requires an exact angle. Another key element increasing the setup's viability for 120 was the Orthogonal Jones dictionary, which lists every valid setup for every frame of wall kick on the second glitchy wall kick [13] . Carpetless was first used in a world record by Puncayshun [14] , and has been in every world record since.  Lakitu Bounce Lakitu Bounce, in speedrunning context, is a trick Mario uses to in  Rainbow Ride  to reach the ship faster. It is done by triple jumping on the rotating octagons, wall kicking off of the side of the wooden ramp, and bouncing off the lakitu to get onto the ramp. From there, Mario can reach the ship quickly by climbing the pole and traversing the blue blocks. This trick is notorious for its difficulty, as it's very precise and needs to be done twice very late into a run. Owlless Owlless is a trick used in the mission  Fall onto the Caged Island  that skips using the owl. Players first head to the rotating platform, and then  triple jump  or  double jump  and wall kick into the cage. Although it is faster to  sideflip  instead, it is much more difficult to execute. Pillarless Pillarless is a  bloated bob-omb  trick in  Shifting Sand Land  that gets the player into the pyramid from the upper entrance without using the pillars, as the name suggests. This is used for  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  and  Pyramid Puzzle . It is done by grabbing a bloated bob omb, holding it hands free, and then travelling up the pyramid and clipping through the entrance. This trick in considered very difficult to perform. Ship Clip The ship clip is used in  Jolly Roger Bay  to get into the sunken ship without luring the eel out, a time consuming maneuver. By swimming into the corner of the ship,  Mario  can clip through and enter the warp behind the eel. Sicko Kick The Sicko Kick is performed in the cave section of  Tiny Huge Island 's 100 Coin Star, during the jump to the platform with the blue coin switch. The (much) safer way to cross this gap is with a double-jump, but there is a very short window wherein a jump kick is sufficient. Side Kick In the stage  Lethal Lava Land  the star  Red-Hot Log Rolling  can be obtained by going around a small obstacle course and getting to it with the rolling logs. Players eventually found you can just triple jump from the stone archway at the beginning of the level and fly over the gate blocking you from the star. Eventually, players found that there is a platform near the gate in which if you do a triple jump and then a wall kick, you can get on top of said fence and then get the star like that which was faster and didn't require the wing cap. Volcano Lava Boost In  Lethal Lava Land  the star  Hot-Foot-It into the Volcano  can be obtained by climbing the volcano. Players found that with clever use of  Lava Boosting  and a triple jump the player can scale the lavafall to get to the top rather quickly.

{"prompt": "Explain Downwarp", "completion": "A  downwarp  can refer to any action that results in Mario's position being suddenly shifted downwards. A variety of tricks can lead to a downwarp. Contents 1   Star Dance Downwarp 1.1   Star/Pole Downwarp 1.2   Cannonless 1.3   Platform moves out from under Mario 2   Sliding downwarps 2.1   Pedro spot Downwarp 2.2   Midair walk Downwarp 3   Squish Downwarp 4   Exposed Ceiling Downwarp 5   Grab Downwarp Star Dance Downwarp When in star dance, mario's position is constantly set of the referenced floor (the floor below him). Thus if he is in the air, he is downwarped to the floor below. This behavior is due to the call to the internal method  stop_and_set_height_to_floor  which is also called by  Ledge Grab , Ledge Climb Slow,  Ledge Climb Down ,  Ledge Climb Fast ,  Metal Water Standing ,  Hold Metal Water Standing ,  Metal Water Jump Land ,  Hold Metal Water Jump Land ,  Metal Water Fall Land ,  Hold Metal Water Fall Land ,  Disappeared ,  Standing Death ,  Electrocution ,  Suffocation ,  Death On Back ,  Death On Stomach ,  Unlocking Key Door ,  Unlocking Star Door ,  Pushing Door ,  Warp Door Spawn ,  Spawn Spin Landing ,  Spawn No Spin Landing ,  Bbh Enter Spin ,  Teleport Fade Out ,  Teleport Fade In ,  Shocked ,  Squished .  Head Stuck In Ground ,  Butt Stuck In Ground ,  Feet Stuck In Ground , and (a few Intro, Peach, and Credits cutscene actions that you can ignore).  Note that this does not include  Star Dance Water .  Star/Pole Downwarp If Mario collects a star while climbing a pole, he is instantly snapped to the floor below him. In most cases, such as the trees in [Bob-omb Battlefield], this only results in Mario being warped a small distance downward as the trees are near the ground to begin with. However, in  Dire, Dire Docks , collecting a star while riding one of the moving poles can result in Mario being snapped to the floor under the water below him. Cannonless When doing the cannonless strat, Mario downwarps. Platform moves out from under Mario This causes the floor under Mario to not be the platform but possibly a floor more under the platform. Sliding downwarps (Note: icecream17 currently has no idea where exactly the relevant code is, and so can't explain exactly how sliding causes downwarps.) Pedro spot  Downwarp In a pedro spot you're often interacting with a floor in  front  of you, thus the floor below you could be arbitrarily far, and you can enter the  Start Sliding  action. Ways to start sliding using a pedro spot: Diving  into a pedro spot (downwarps through the  Dive Slide  action). Midair walk  Downwarp If you try to start sliding using midair walk via double turnaround, you don't downwarp. But otherwise, when pressing Z, you do. Squish Downwarp Squished  is another action that calls  stop_and_set_height_to_floor . Exposed Ceiling Downwarp Grab Downwarp"}

Keep in mind that if there are any blue stars (uncollected) present in the star selection menu, then the last version that can be selected is the first blue star and not the stars after it: Version 1 : Accessed by selecting Star 1. The penguin is not present to challenge Mario at sliding. Version 2 : Accessed by selecting Star 2, 3, 4, and 6. The penguin is present, challenging Mario to the race. Version 3 : Accessed by selecting Star 5. This version is identical to Version 2 except that the snowman's body is present to allow Mario to bring it down to meet its head. Additionally, the penguin will become a fat penguin once 120 stars are collected. Coins The coin placement in this course is unique, with how half of the coins are in the main area, and half are in the slide. If all of the coins are collected, a maximum of 154 coins are collectible. There is a theoretical way to raise this maximum - with the use of penguin  Time Stop , you could collect coins and then enter the chimney to get infinite coins. However, no method has been successful in getting Mario to the chimney, and the max height reached is only near the blue coin block.

Slip Slidin' Away  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/vqbq-yeLWbI   Since Mario already starts out at higher grounds of the course, and there are teleporters available to teleport Mario back to the top, this star presents no issues. That being said, frame-walking or dive grinding is required to get up a slope to reach the chimney that leads to the slide. Once exiting out the slide, the star is reachable with a precise dive recover (the star is only 257 units above ground [2] ). Li'l Penguin Lost  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/oXAjWluPjho   Mario frame-walks or dive grinding up the slope to reach where the little penguin is. He then grabs it, sliding down the mountain to give the baby back to mother penguin. The rewarded star is above the maximum height that a dive recover can reach (288 units), and thus, Mario needs to use vertical wind or teleport all the way back to the top and drop down from above to collect the star. Big Penguin Race  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/TQMbgDeAMRU   Enter the slide in the same fashion done in Star 1, and then beat the penguin in the race. Afterwards, collect the star. Frosty Slide for 8 Red Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/XH2exVpK6EI   Seven of the eight red coins require no tricky techniques, but the one at the top of the ski lift is a bit more difficult as the walls around the platform are too high to dive recover onto. There are a few different ways to collect it, with the original one being to activate the ski lift, quickly warp back to the top of the stage, collect the red coin, and land back on the ski lift as its moving down. It is also possible to collect it and survive using a precise ledge grab, a slide kick bounce, or a misalignment. Snowman's Lost His Head  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/t_ETEIo3fvs   With the convenient slope located in the beginning, Mario can reach the Snowman's body and help it roll down the mountain to reach its head with Mario's guidance. While the star is too high to reach without jumping, there is a Spindrift nearby to provide the necessary height to reach it. Wall Kicks Will Work  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/NnC5n70j1KE   The main trick is landing on a  Spindrift  to activate twirling, then use a specific trajectory with a high speed to reach the star from above to bypass the need to long jump or wall kick. While the maximum speed of twirling is 31, Pannenkoek found a way to twirl faster than that. It is done by  not  steering Mario most of the time to conserve the high speed achieved by sliding down from the tiptop of the mountain, where it is reached by frame-walking. CCM 100 Coins  (0x) Video:  https://youtu.be/jWjQ0Bwbbxk   By collecting the coins in the big slide (where there are 72 coins) and sliding down the outer slide of the mountain, Mario would gather enough coins to spawn the 100 coin star. Other challenges In the  Coinless Challenge , excluding coin missions, all stars can be collected in isolation, with  Slip Slidin' Away  and  Big Penguin Race  requiring a clip with the baby penguin to enter the slide.  Snowman's Lost His Head  cannot be collected in a full-game run, since the red coin star must be completed first. The same stars can be collected in the  CCC Challenge . In the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  Slip Slidin' Away ,  Frosty Slide for 8 Red Coins ,  Wall Kicks Will Work , and  100 Coins  can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge ,  Li'l Penguin Lost ,  Frosty Slide for 8 Red Coins ,  Snowman's Lost His Head , and  100 Coins  can be collected. In the  Pacifist Challenge , all seven stars can be collected. In the  B Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 B presses.  Li'l Penguin Lost  requires leading the baby penguin to the vertical wind. In the  Z Button Challenge , the entire course is possible in 0 Z presses. In the  UBER Challenge ,  Slip Slidin' Away  and  Wall Kicks Will Work  can be collected. There are multiple  unsolved challenges  in this course: getting more coins than intended, reaching a  Parallel Universe  from both areas of the level, grabbing the second baby penguin without pressing B, and getting hurt by a penguin. Trivia Cool, Cool Mountain was the first main course to be completed entirely in 0 A presses, being completely solved in 2011.

To complete it, Mario must go to the top of the fortress and defeat King Whomp by ground pounding on his back 3 times. This can be done quickly by jumping and ground pounding as he faceplants. Contents 1   A Button Challenge 1.1   Original Strategy 2   TAS History 2.1   TAS Strategy 3   References A Button Challenge Current Strategy The mission can be completed TAS only  ABC  in just over 40 seconds. [6]  The main challenges are ground pounding King Whomp, and collecting the star since it's too high for a dive recover. Mario gets onto the checkered elevator by walking up the steep slope opposite the wall beside the elevator, and diving onto the elevator. As Mario fights King Whomp, he lures him to the correct spot. He ground pounds King Whomp by performing a dive recover just before King Whomp falls to the ground, bringing him to the top using a  misalignment  on King Whomp and  conserving vertical speed  from the dive recover. He activates it using platform displacement, allowing him to ground pound. On the 3rd shot, Mario uses a punch to activate his vertical speed. After the text finishes, Mario does a dive towards the star, allowing him to reach the star. Original Strategy The original method of completing this 0x was to  clone  the star.  [7] Mario first brings a cork box to the top of the level. The box is brought onto the elevator by squeezing Mario between the elevator and the small Whomp. Mario then dive recovers off the small whomp, and regrabs the box as it falls off the elevator, transporting it to the top. Mario then heads to the arrow platform and collects 4 coins, leaving 4 left. This will be useful for cloning the star. Mario ground pounds under the elevator to get the first 2 hits on King Whomp. He first lets King Whomp break the box, and Mario picks up the box as it breaks, holding a fake cork box. Mario loads the 4 coins still on the arrow platform so that he is holding the correct vacant object slot, then uses King Whomp to hold the object hands free. Mario falls onto the elevator. With his object hands free, he can ground pound. Mario grinds on the elevator to keep the object hands free, and ground pounds King Whomp for a third time, killing him. The star takes the vacant object slot in Mario's hands, allowing him to clone it.

It was discovered that a  Glitchy Wall Kick  could be used to get on to the ramp, allowing Mario to quickly climb up and maintain speed. In late 2010, it was found that it\u2019s faster to slide across the slope beside the ramp, climb up the brown slope, and from the falling bridge wall kick off of the wall there. This eventually evolved into  Sideflipping , then wall kick diving, which was much smoother and allowed Mario to get close to the wall without Ledge Grabbing.

{"prompt": "Explain C%5E Hyperspeed", "completion": "C^ Hyperspeed  is a  hyperspeed glitch  that allows Mario to build up unbounded speed by sliding down a slippery slope while trying to enter first person mode. Execution The trick happens when the player enters first person mode by pressing C^. Usually Mario's speed decreases and he comes to a stop, but if he is on a very slippery slope (type 0x13) he will accelerate. If he is facing uphill, he will get negative speed, and if he is facing downhill, he will get positive speed. If he is facing exactly 90\u00b0 to the slope, he will still gain negative speed. The C^ action can be cancelled with a kick, a punch, becoming airborne, or hitting a wall. If it is not cancelled, Mario will slow down and enter first person mode once he exits the slope.

This allows Mario to receive a constant push from the shell's  hitbox , similar to a  Bloated Bob-omb , but still have access to most actions such as jumping, side-flipping, swimming, etc. Also similar to a Bloated Bob-omb, speed values are not affected. The Shell Mario glitch is canceled by: Walking Receiving knockback Catching fire Entering a cannon Entering vertical wind Twirling Being grabbed Shell Mario glitch can only be performed in  Tiny-Huge Island [1]  and  Snowman's Land . [2] The shell hitbox pushes Mario 89 units forward every frame. Execution To enter Shell Mario, a Koopa shell must be positioned in shallow water so that Mario can touch the shell and enter the \"in water\" action on the same frame. A method of entering Shell Mario also exists that involves colliding with out of bounds while riding a shell and entering water, though the specific process is unknown. The same process can also be performed with a shell clone, albeit without the pushing effect.

{"prompt": "Explain Double Red Coin Sound Glitch", "completion": "The  double red coin sound glitch  is a glitch in the Japanese version of Super Mario 64. As the name implies, the glitch causes the sound played when collecting a  red coin  to be played twice.  Explanation Certain objects that need to play a sound spawn an object known as a sound spawner to play that sound. These include the breaking sound for breakable walls, the sound of falling pillars hitting the ground, and, in the Japanese version, the sound from a red coin being collected. For red coins, after 30 frames the sound spawner unloads and this sends a signal to stop playing the sound, cutting it off if it is still playing. However, if the sound spawner unloads within the same frame that the sound finished, the signal to stop playing is instead interpreted as a signal to start playing the sound. In the case of the red coin sound, the sound actually lasts for 1.2 seconds but is silent after 30 frames making the cutoff unnoticeable. With the right amount of lag the sound spawner despawning can be delayed so that the despawn occurs on the same frame as the sound ending, which causes the sound to play again. In US and later versions, this does not occur.

He can be groundpounded to lower his neck, which lets Mario get onto his head, giving him a higher spot to jump from to either the star platform or the entrance to the  Cavern of the Metal Cap . Whilst on Dorrie, Mario can control him by facing in the direction he wants Dorrie to turn, or to face forvard if Dorrie needs to go forwards . The sign A sign near the elevator leading to the lake reads the following:  \u201cA gentle sea dragon lives here. Pound on his back to make him lower his head. Don't become his lunch.\u201d  This text is misleading though, because Dorrie does not have a hurtbox.

Related Wing Cap ,  Vanish Cap Found In Whomp's Fortress ,  Jolly Roger Bay ,  Hazy Maze Cave ,  Dire, Dire Docks ,  Wet Dry World ,  Cavern of the Metal Cap ,  Bowser in the Dark World The  Metal Cap  is a powerup that can be found in green [!] blocks after the green  cap switch  in  Cavern of the Metal Cap  is pressed. When worn, it allows Mario to sink and walk underwater, and makes Mario invincible to most forms of damage. It expires after 20 seconds. Contents 1   Glitches 1.1   Damage with the Metal Cap 2   Interactions 2.1   Enemies that don't die 2.2   Other interactions 3   See also 4   References Glitches The Metal Cap, like all caps, can be used to perform the  Hat in Hand  glitch. Damage with the Metal Cap Even though the Metal Cap canonically makes Mario invincible to all forms of damage, there are still several ways to take damage and/or die while wearing it. [1]  These include: Small or large fall damage; Mario will take damage the same as if he didn't have the cap. Getting burnt by fire (not lava) before putting on the cap; Mario will continue his fire burning animation and will continue to lose health. Entering water from the side so that Mario takes damage from being underwater for a handful in frames, but in such a way that he won't be able to  water upwarp  to the surface to regain more health; this can be done in the  Wet-Dry World  dry pipe, where the pipe's ceiling prevents Mario from upwarping to the surface. Taking knockback underwater; while the knockback doesn't damage Mario, it renders him vulnerable to the effect of the water. Riding on the water shell; this can be done by cloning the metal cap to be near the water shell. While riding on the water shell, Metal Mario is able to lose health from the water as if he wasn't wearing the metal cap. Being eaten by  Bubba ; this is not possible to do in the game and requires hacks to see. Interactions Most enemies die upon touching Metal Mario. No attacks by enemies have any effect either, except that of Bubba. Enemies that don't die Not all enemies that come in contact with Metal Mario will die. Here are enemies that don't die on contact. This list is incomplete. This list still includes enemies that can be killed normally, as long as those enemies do not die on contact from Metal Mario. Mr. I; Metal Mario will receive knockback. Bubba; Metal Mario will die. Amp; Metal Mario will get shocked. Thwomp, Whomp; Metal Mario will get squished. Other interactions Piranha Plant; The plant will die, but Mario does also receive knockback. Getting Shocked; Mario can still get shocked, but this doesn't lower his health. Getting Squished; Mario will get squished, but this doesn't kill the Thwomp not does Mario get damaged. Lava; Using hacks you can show that lava doesn't hurt Mario. (The Metal Cap cannot be obtained in any stage where there is lava.) The lava will however make Mario do the lava boost.

It is accessible after collecting 10 stars; a bright light shines on the sun mat in the foyer, and looking at the source with the C-Up button sends you to TotWC. A first person angle of -6144 is required to enter, making it impossible to enter without the joystick. However it is possible to press the button without joystick once in the level.   The ceiling of the castle foyer as viewed with C^ from the central sun carpet. Looking at this spot with 10 or more stars warps you into the level. Contents 1   Coins 2   A Button Challenge 3   Other Challenges 4   Trivia Coins Collecting all of the coins in this course is deceptively difficult, and was at one point thought to be impossible due to the difficult maneuvering. There's a total of 63 coins here.

Other Challenges This star cannot be collected in the  Coinless Challenge ,  CCC Challenge ,  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , and  UBER Challenge . It is worth noting that the Wing Cap Switch can be pressed without the joystick, but the star cannot be collected. This star can be collected in the  Capless/Cannonless Challenge ,  No Buttons Allowed Challenge ,  Pacifist Challenge ,  B Button Challenge ,  Z Button Challenge , and  Floor is Lava Challenge . Note that the wing cap  effect  from entering the course is allowed for the Capless/Cannonless challenge. This star is also one of the few that can be collected in the  Floor is Lava Challenge , as Mario starts the level flying. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to reach a  Parallel Universe . Trivia The only time a C button is required in the game is to enter TotWC.

Privacy Policy Continue Dismiss Pole Glitch Pole Glitch is a very precise trick where it is important to do dustless movement. You want to maintain Mario's speed the best you can starting from this image.     Do not get any dust frames on the first rollout, or the trick gets harder.   Jumpdiving between these 2 red lines works best. This part is lenient. If you jumpdive early you will probably bonk on the bottom of the pole. Once again, try to be dustless on the following rollout.   You will land here after the rollout, and the single jump will need to be on the 1st frame after you land. This allows you to get as much height as possible. Hold A until you see Mario has warped. If you release too early, you will bonk. Tutorial Load video YouTube YouTube might collect personal data.

{"prompt": "Explain Instant release", "completion": "Demonstration of instant release Instant Release  refers to techniques in which a held object is released instantly. Since the  HOLP  only updates when an object is drawn in Mario's hands, this allows Mario to move objects to the HOLP without updating it. However, because the object is dropped and not thrown, the object will appear at the HOLP laterally but at Mario's current height and not the height of the HOLP. Since the object must be picked up and dropped on the same frame, there are only two known methods of doing the technique:  Diving into an object and simultaneously bonking on a wall, ceiling or out-of-bounds Diving into an object and simultaneously taking   large fall damage Uses Instant release is used in the  A Button Challenge  to move   Bob-ombs  out-of-bounds in  Tick Tock Clock  so that they can be reactivated later on.  This is used for the stars  Roll into the Cage  and  Get a Hand . It was formerly used in  Stomp on the Thwomp  but its use in that star has since been obsoleted.

{"prompt": "Explain 100 Coin Star (Shifting Sand Land)", "completion": "100 Coin Stars  are  stars  that appear after collecting 100 coins in all 15  main courses . They differ from all other stars in the main courses in that they appear directly above Mario instead of at fixed location. 100 Coin Stars appear in no other courses, even if the player manages to collect 100 coins. 100 Coin Stars are unique in that when Mario collects one, he is not ejected from the current course back to the castle. Instead, a  textbox  appears, and Mario is allowed to continue exploring the course. Contents 1   Phenomena 1.1   Coin Count vs. Coin Display 1.2   Coin Overflow 2   Uses 2.1   A Button Challenge 2.2   No Joystick Allowed 3   References Phenomena It has been suggested that this section be merged with  Coin Limit . ( Discuss ) Reason: duplicated information  (December 2018) Coin Count vs. Coin Display The game uses two different variables to track Mario's coins: the  coin count  and the  coin display . The former is updated the instant Mario collects a coin, while the latter is used to display the coin count on-screen.  The coin count is set to 0 when the game starts and when entering a level. When exiting a level, the coin count is not reset, and examining the game's memory reveals that it continues to be updated when coins are collected. A 100 Coin Star appears when this variable equals 100, so long as Mario is in a main course. The coin display will increment by 1 until it catches up with the coin count. In particular, the coin display only increments when it is less than the coin count and the  global timer  is odd. Using this method, the programmers intended the coin display to update once every two frames. However, by manipulating the global timer through  pause buffering , one can prevent the coin display from updating altogether [1] . Coin Overflow Both the coin count and the coin display are stored as 16-bit signed shorts, so their values can range between -32768 and 32767 inclusive. In all versions of the game after the original Japanese N64 version, the coin count is capped at 999 on every frame. However, in the Japanese version, a bug is present in the game's code that sets the life counter to 999 when the coin counter exceeds 999: // On every frame... if (lives > 100)      lives = 100; if (coins > 999)     lives = 999;  //! this should use \"coins\" instead of \"lives\" The effects of this bug are twofold: the coin count can exceed 999, and the lives count is erroneously set to 999.  Because the coin count can exceed 999, using  infinite coin glitches , it can reach 32767. Due to signed integer overflow, if one more coin is collected, the coin counter would become -32768. Collecting coins will continue to increase this value. Note that the coin display would remain 32767, for it only updates when it is less than the coin count. If one collects 32868 more coins, or 65636 coins in total, the coin counter will equal 100, spawning another 100 Coin Star. Although this star will appear yellow, collecting it will not increase the game's star count from 120 to 121 or more. This is because each star is represented in memory by 1 bit, and when a star is collected, the game uses the bitwise OR operator to store this information. Since Mario's life count is stored as an 8-bit signed byte, when it is set to 999, the upper byte is discarded and the number that is stored is -25. Since the above code runs every frame, Mario's life count is constantly set to -25. This means collecting  1-Ups  will not change this value. Since Mario's coin count is not reset when he exits a level, losing a life will also not change the life count until another main course is entered. However, once Mario's coin count becomes negative, the life counter can be modified again. Uses Because 100 coin stars can spawn anywhere you can collect a coin, they are useful for various challenges. A Button Challenge When Mario is in freefall, if he is close enough to an edge, he will perform a ledge-grab. In doing so, his height will be updated to the height of the ledge above him, awarding him a small height bonus. Since Mario cannot ledge-grab after dive recovering, dive recovering near a ledge in the A Button Challenge forfeits this height bonus. In certain scenarios, one can use the  Star Dance Clip  (SDC) to gain this height bonus without pressing A. When Mario collects a star, his action is set to one that allows him to perform a ledge-grab, regardless of his previous action. If he is close enough to a ledge, he is placed on top of it before doing his star dance animation. Since 100 Coin Stars do not eject Mario from the course, players can use this height bonus to collect stars without pressing A. The Star Dance Clip can be used in combination with  Vertical Speed Conservation , which puts Mario into a free-fall state, by ground-pounding to gain height before collecting a 100 Coin Star. In the A Button Challenge, the SDC is used: to get on the  Bullet Bill Block  in  To the Top of the Fortress  0x [2] along with a  Crazy box  and three  Scuttlebugs  to reach the mansion roof in  Big Boo's Balcony  0x [3] to get to the highest walkway 0x in  Stomp on the Thwomp [4] among other A press saves. Going to  Hazy Maze Cave  0x [5]  also uses a star dance clip, although this is not from a 100 coin star (but from a MIPS star instead). But the star dance clip works the same way. No Joystick Allowed The 100 coin star is currently used to reset Mario's ascent of steep slopes, which is useful near the top of the pyramid in  Shifting Sand Land  to collect the stars  Inside the Ancient Pyramid  and  Pyramid Puzzle .

{"prompt": "Explain Trapdoor to Bowser in the Dark World", "completion": "The entrance to  Bowser in the Dark World  is deceiving. In a casual playthrough, the entrance appears to be a painting of Princess Peach, but upon approaching it, the painting changes to an image of Bowser--Mario is thwarted by a trapdoor in the carpet, leading to the stage. (There is no level geometry beyond the trapdoor and the Bowser painting itself has no entrance.) Reverse Spawning Displacement Because the trapdoor is directly over the warp to the stage, Mario can still be standing on it on the frame that he warps, which can lead to  spawning displacement  in Bowser in the Dark World if the trapdoor loaded into a sufficiently-high object slot. Mario is displaced horizontally 300 units in the Z direction, and will land on the expected starting platform, close to its right edge. This 300-unit displacement is inherited from a revolving elevator platform's initialization. Revolving elevator platforms are initially spawned at their axle, and then given one frame of translational velocity to snap them to their intended positions before any revolution regins. Thus, Mario inherits a fixed translational displacement, not rotational displacement. The first confirmed method of manipulating the trapdoor into a high object slot (slot 102) is to visit the basement, generate dust, and return to the lobby.

{"prompt": "Explain Backwards Long Jump - Side BLJ", "completion": "The  Backwards  Long Jump  hyperspeed method, or  BLJ  for short, is the most famous  hyperspeed  method in Super Mario 64. Due to their versatility, BLJs are commonly used in all kinds of  speedruns  and  challenges . When Mario initiates a long jump, his horizontal speed is multiplied by 3/2. A BLJ occurs when a backwards long jump is interrupted before the effects of drag can counteract the speed gain from the 3/2 multiplier. This does not occur with forwards long jumps because long jumps have a \"hard cap\" of +48 horizontal speed which Mario's speed cannot exceed. No such cap exists in the negative direction because normally the \"soft cap\" of -16 speed from drag is easily enough to stop any speed gain. There are several different types of BLJs. The distinguishing feature of different types of BLJs is what they use to interrupt the long jump: Slope BLJs use slopes by going up the slope. Stair BLJs use stairs by going up the stairs. Elevator BLJs use the upwards movement of an elevator or other object. Side BLJs  use two floors at slightly different levels by oscillating between them. Ceiling BLJs use an exposed ceiling or low-hanging ceiling by making Mario hit his head and start travelling downwards faster. BLJs can also be  pause buffered  to increase the amount of long jumps that can be performed in a given amount of time or space. The BLJ glitch was patched in the  Shindou release , and therefore also the  iQue version . This also means that any emulator releases of these game versions lack the BLJ glitch, namely the  Japanese Wii VC release , the  Japanese Wii U VC release , and all versions of  Super Mario 3D All-Stars . Contents 1   Slope BLJ 2   Stair BLJ 3   Elevator BLJ 4   Side BLJ 5   Ceiling BLJ Slope BLJ A slope BLJ is performed by interrupting a backwards long jump using a rising slope. Because Mario usually lands immediately after long jumping (assuming a steep enough slope), slope BLJs are normally pause bufferable. Stair BLJ A stair BLJ is similar to a slope BLJ, except using stairs instead of slopes to achieve the rising floor effect. Stair BLJs often cannot be performed when there are wall hitboxes sticking out from the stairs because the walls prevent Mario from landing on the higher floor. Similarly to slope BLJs, stair BLJs are often pause bufferable. Stair BLJs are often used for bypassing doors in the castle. Elevator BLJ Elevator BLJs are also conceptually similar to slope BLJs and stair BLJs in that they too use the floor under Mario rising to interrupt Mario's long jump. Elevator BLJs use elevators as the rising floor. Elevator BLJs are a common solution for when one wishes to quickly get a lot of speed since while slope BLJs and stair BLJs can only last until the slope or stair runs out or Mario hits out-of-bounds, elevator BLJs can last as long as the elevator is moving and don't need to stop when Mario hits out-of-bounds. Because of this, elevator BLJs are the only type of BLJ that can reach  PU  speed. Side BLJ Side BLJs or SBLJs are the most complex type of BLJ. A side BLJ is performed by oscillating between two floors at slightly different heights to achieve an effect similar to a stair BLJ but without needing a long, wall-less staircase. Side BLJs are performed by first having Mario face slightly to the higher floor (so that when Mario's moving backwards, he moves down to the lower floor), then straining to the higher floor during the long jump so that Mario snaps up to it. After long jumping from the lower floor, Mario ends up on the higher floor due to the straining, but because of the direction Mario is facing he snaps down to the lower floor on the next frame. This can then be repeated. Because side BLJs require 1 extra frame per long jump for Mario to snap back down to the lower floor, they cannot be pause buffered. Ceiling BLJ A ceiling BLJ is performed by having Mario hit a ceiling during his long jumps so that Mario starts moving downwards earlier, meaning there's less time for drag to slow Mario down. Ceiling BLJs can be performed with low ceilings or with  exposed ceilings .  Lobby Backwards Long Jump  is an example of this type of BLJ. v \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 d \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 e Glitches Hyperspeed Action-based Backwards Long Jump  \u2022  Hyperspeed Walking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Wall Kicks  \u2022  Backward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Forward shell hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Turnaround  \u2022  Hyperspeed Water Sliding  \u2022  C^ hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Punching  \u2022  Hyperspeed Grinding  \u2022  Hyperspeed Jump Kicking  \u2022  Hyperspeed Slide Kicking  \u2022  Wind Hyperspeed  \u2022  Hyperspeed Braking  \u2022  10k glitch Freefall-based Boo Hyperspeed  \u2022  Pedro Spot  \u2022  Wiggler Hyperspeed Object-based Bully battery Faux Hyperspeed Bloated Bob-omb  \u2022  Shell Mario Other Glitches Speed Manipulation Speed conservation  \u2022\u00a0 Vertical Speed Conservation Action Bugs Glitchy Ledge Grab \u00a0\u2022  Hat-in-Hand  \u2022  Indefinite owl flight  \u2022  Star Dance Clip Object Interaction Bugs Astral projection  \u2022  Cloning  \u2022  Instant release  \u2022  Ride cancelling  \u2022  Chuckya Wrong Throw  \u2022  Light Grabbing Object Bugs Enemy Manipulation  \u2022  Koopa the Quick Manipulation  \u2022  Object adoption  \u2022  Breaking-disappearing Cork Box glitch  \u2022  Mario's Platform Adventure Quarter Frame  Transitions Glitchy Wall Kick  \u2022  Subframe Grinding Engine Bugs Parallel Universe  \u2022  Spawning displacement  \u2022  Water seam  \u2022   Time Stop Glitch  \u2022  Behind Camera Anywhere Audio Bugs Double Red Coin Sound Glitch System Bugs SheNaNigans  \u2022  Wii VC Round-to-Zero Level Geometry Bugs Misalignment  \u2022  Pedro Spot Other Pages Crash  \u2022  Infinite coin glitches  \u2022  List of unsolved glitches  \u2022  Right-Angle sliding  \u2022  Softlock  \u2022  Upwarp"}
{"prompt": "Explain Amp", "completion": "Amp Technical Constants Object Group General Actor Actor Group Common 0 Model ID 0xC2 Tangibility Radius 1000 Hitbox Interaction Type Shocks Damage 1 Radius 40 Height 50 Down Offset 40 Code Initialization Behavior Script   [1] Behavior Code   [2] Amp  is an enemy that appears in many levels. There are two types of Amp; a homing Amp, and an Amp that moves in a circle. The circling Amp can also be stationary if the circle's radius is set to 0. When Mario collides with an Amp, he is shocked and takes 1 damage.  Contents 1   Locations 2   Behavior 2.1   Homing Amp 2.2   Circling Amp 3   References Locations The following courses have Amps. All of them only have Circling Amps unless stated otherwise: Bowser in the Dark World Shifting Sand Land  (Both types) Vanish Cap Under the Moat Snowman's Land Wet-Dry World Bowser in the Fire Sea Tick Tock Clock Rainbow Ride Bowser in the Sky Behavior Homing Amp Homing Amp is initialized at its home with a gravity value of 0, friction of 1 and buoyancy of 1. The Amp\u2019s Y-value sinusoidally oscillates 40 units around its average Y-value, which is initialized as the Y-value of the Amp\u2019s home. Homing Amp starts at 1/10th of its normal size and is invisible to Mario. When Mario gets within 800 units of the Homing Amp\u2019s home, the Amp will begin to appear. The Amp grows over the course of 30 frames, increasing in size by 0.1 units for one frame and then by 0.03 units for each frame after. At the end of the 30 frames, the Amp is at 97% of its final size. Once an additional 61 frames have passed, the Amp grows to its final size and begins to chase Mario. If Mario is within 11.25 degrees of the Amp\u2019s line of sight, the Amp \u201clocks on\u201d and chases Mario in a straight line at 15 units/second for 32 frames. During this period, the Amp\u2019s average Y-value is adjusted to align with Mario\u2019s head (precisely Mario\u2019s graphical position + 150 units). If the Amp is not locked on to Mario, the Amp moves forward at 10 units/second while turning toward Mario. In this case, the Amp\u2019s average Y-value is set to move towards Mario\u2019s graphical position + 250 units. If Mario goes further than 1500 units from the Amp\u2019s home, the Amp will move forward for another 152 frames and then reset to its original home in its initial state. Circling Amp The Circling Amp can be initialized with 4 different radii: 200 units, 300 units, 400 units and 0 units. If the Amp has a circling radius of 0 units, the amp remains in a fixed position while turning toward Mario and oscillating 40 units around its initial Y-value. If the Amp\u2019s circling radius is not 0, it moves in a circle of the specified radius around its home with a period of 64 frames and oscillates 60 units around its initial Y-value.

Contents 1   Description 2   Locations 3   Size Manipulation 4   References Description If he is bounced on,  Mario  will start  twirling  and the Fly Guy will die and drop two yellow  coins . Any other form of attack will not put Mario in a twirling state. There are two types of Fly Guys: ones that shoot fire and ones that don't. Locations Fly Guy appears in: Shifting Sand Land Snowman's Land Tall, Tall Mountain Tiny-Huge Island Rainbow Ride Size Manipulation Mario can manipulate Fly Guy's size by running below him, causing his size to decrease. [3]  Over time, Fly Guy's size will become negative, where his visuals will become upside down. The size does not have a cap, thus it can become arbitrarily large (if negative) barring float limitations. There is no known way to arbitrarily  increase  his size. This does not affect his hitbox, but it does affect the height Mario is put on when he bounces on the Fly Guy. Mario cannot bounce on Fly Guy while he has a negative size. Size manipulation is a consequence of Fly Guy's shooting fire animation, so it can only be done on the Fly Guys that can shoot fire.

Upon opening, there are three windows with Princess Peach engraved upon them. The one to the right contains a warp that will take you to PSS. This secret stage contains 2 stars, one in an  item box  at the end of the slide, and one that spawns from the slide upon completing it in under 21 seconds.

The Princess's Secret Slide (Normal) Video:  \"SM64 - The Princess's Secret Slide - 1x A Presses\" An a press is required to collect the star that spawns from the box, because the star is 319 units high [1] , but the maximum height of a star that a dive recover can reach is only 288 units high. Do note that it is possible to open the box that spawns the star, just not collect it. The Princess's Secret Slide (Under 21\"0) Video:  \"SM64 - The Princess's Secret Slide Under 21\"0 - 0x A Presses\" This star is similar to casual play, except that a dive recover is used to collect the star. Other Challenges In the  Coinless Challenge ,  Capless/Cannonless Challenge ,  CCC Challenge ,  Pacifist Challenge ,  B Button Challenge ,  Z Button Challenge , and  UBER Challenge , both stars can be collected. In the  No Buttons Allowed Challenge , neither star can be collected. In the  No Joystick Allowed Challenge , only the box star can be collected. There is an  unsolved challenge  in this course, to reach a  Parallel Universe . Slide Skip Mario first slides down the slide in the buttslide  action . When he reaches the first corner, he bumps into it to begin sliding backwards. Then, as soon as the low walls appear, he runs into the wall to be reflected into forward sliding and jumps to land on a lower part of the slide [2] .
